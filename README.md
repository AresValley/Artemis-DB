## Media

### Waterfall/Spectrum (FFT)
The image is converted back to png from the original format. The resolution is arbitrary (yet).

### Audio Sample
The standard format of an audio sample is .ogg with a sampling rate equal to the original recording. The audio codec used depends on the native format:

- **vorbis**, if the original audio is compressed
- **flac**, if the original audio is lossless

## License
Artemis is licensed under the [**GPL-3**](https://github.com/AresValley/Artemis/blob/master/LICENSE) license.
