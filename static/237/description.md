Digital Advanced Mobile Phone System (D-AMPS), also known as IS-54 and IS-136, is a second generation (2G) mobile phone system standard. D-AMPS, which is a development of the 1G standard analog AMPS, was able to facilitate a smooth transition from AMPS by using existing channels and bands.

D-AMPS uses π/4 DQPSK modulation. The same FDMA channeling used in AMPS is used in D-AMPS; however, each 30 kHz channel is divided into three time slots with TDMA, allowing 3 users per carrier, increasing the number of possible users on the system.

IS-136 is a development of IS-54 which adds an additional TDMA digital control channel (DCCH) which uses π/4 DQPSK, contrary to FSK used in the control channel in IS-54 and analog AMPS. Additionally, IS-136 includes other features including security and SMS.

IS-54 was designed only for the AMPS (850 MHz) cellular band, while IS-136 can operate on both cellular (850 MHz) and PCS (1900 MHz) bands. In the 90's, until the early 2000's, AT&T Wireless and other North American wireless operators used IS-136 for 2G, and branded it as "Digital PCS".
