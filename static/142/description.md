Digital Mobile Radio (DMR) is an open digital mobile radio standard defined in the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) Standard TS 102 361 parts 1â€“4 and used in commercial products around the world. DMR, along with P25 and NXDN48 are the main competitor technologies in achieving 6.25 kHz equivalent bandwidth using the proprietary AMBE+2 vocoder.

DMR and P25 Phase II both use two-slot TDMA in a 12.5 kHz channel, while NXDN48 uses discrete 6.25 kHz channels using frequency division. DMR was designed with three tiers. DMR tiers I and II (conventional) were first published in 2005, and DMR tier III (trunked) was published in 2012, with manufacturers producing products within a few years of each publication. The primary goal of the standard is to specify a digital system with low complexity, low cost and interoperability across brands, so radio communications purchasers are not locked into a proprietary solution. In practice, many brands have not adhered to this open standard and have introduced proprietary features that make their product offerings non-interoperable.
