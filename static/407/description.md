RDFT is an amateur radio digital mode used to transmit files invented by Barry Sanderson, KB9VAK. Uses DPSK.

RDFT was designed for radio amateurs to send files, primarily pictures, known as Digital SSTV, although it was not very popular. Now it is used almost exclusively by the Cuban Number Station (HM01).

Original applications for coding, modulating, demodulating and decoding, which use DSP techniques to work with PC soundcard, were written by Barry Sanderson, KB9VAK. The only GUI application (which utilizes applications written by KB9VAK) known to copy the files (but not necessarily decrypt them) is DIGTRX made by Roland Zurmely, PY4ZBZ.

This software has been long abandoned for other modes and has been replaced by HamDRM and other similar digital SSTV software.

# Cuban Number Station
The only station known to utilize RDFT is the infamous Cuban Numbers Stations (Enigma designation HM01). HM01 transmits both a synthesized voice signal as well as the RDFT file transfer mode. Files are sent in .TXT format but are encrypted. This station is known to use the broadcast facilities - via a feeder or other unknown means - of Radio Habana.

**UPDATE: As of 5/11/2022: **The station no longer uses RDFT and now uses a new mode called "EasyDRF", which will be added to the wiki when possible.
