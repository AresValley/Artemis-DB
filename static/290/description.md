Motorola's MDC-4800 is a data protocol that was used in ARDIS and DataTAC Networks as well as in MDT networks. RD-LAP was derived from this mode. Also known as Motorola Mobile Data Communications System (MODACOM)

Apart from ARDIS, MDC-4800 was used in MDT, public safety, and other data terminal usages.

# Characteristics
Maximum message size is 2,048 bytes. Max OTA size is 256. GFSK, 4.8 kbps

Convolutionally coded, rate 1/2, constraint length 7, of a 112-bit block. This block is put into a 7x16 matrix in column order and read out in row order.

Interleaving protects 3.3 ms (~16 bits) burst errors 90% of the time.

Packet length is 256 bytes; longer messages are subdivided into 240 byte packets and reassembled at the receiving end.

May also be known as Motorola Mobile Data Communications System (MODACOM).
