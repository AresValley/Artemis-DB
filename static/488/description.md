VDL-M2 (Known as VDL2 or VDLM2) is a means of sending information between aircraft and ground stations. VDL Mode 2 is the only VDL mode being implemented operationally to support Controller Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC). An extension to the AVLC protocol permits ACARS over AVLC (AOA) transmissions. VDL-M2 is implemented by Eurocontrol.
