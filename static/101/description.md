CLOVER-II is the advancement of CLOVER-I, with 4 tone pulses and a max data rate of 750 bps. Also known as Q-CLOVER and QUAD-CLOVER. The symbol rate is always 31.25 Bd. CLOVER-II was the result of the work by Ray Petit W7GHM, and HAL Communications, including the PCI-4000, the P38, and the DSP-4100. The mode was released in late 1992 on HAL transceivers. The last HAL unit to carry Clover II was the DSP4100. Bosnia and Ireland were major users of Clover II.

CLOVER-II uses 4 125 Hz wide tone-pulse subcarriers that are each offset from the base tone by 8ms, so that every 32ms all four tone pulses transmit their cycle. CLOVER-II uses Phase (PSK) or Phase-Amplitude (Circular QAM) shift keying modulation.

There are 4 500 Hz channels defined for CLOVER-II.

- Channel 1: 750 Hz Center Frequency
- Channel 2: 1250 Hz Center Frequency
- Channel 3: 1750 Hz Center Frequency
- Channel 4: 2250 Hz Center Frequency
- Channel 4 is the factory default channel used.

There are 6 main modulation modes:

| Mode  | Description                                  | Data Rate       | ARQ/FEC Support |
|-------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 16P4A | 16-Phase 4-Amplitude Modulation (64-QAM)     | 750 bps Max     | ARQ & FEC       |
| 8P2A  | 8-Phase 2-Amplitude Modulation (16-QAM)      | 500 bps Max     | ARQ & FEC       |
| 8PSM  | 8 Phase Shift-Keying Modulation (8-PSK)      | 375 bps Max     | ARQ & FEC       |
| QPSM  | Quadrature Phase-Shift Keying (QPSK)         | 250 bps Max     | ARQ & FEC       |
| BPSM  | BPSK Binary Phase-Shift Keying (QPSK)        | 125 bps Max     | ARQ & FEC       |
| 2DPSM | BPSK with 2-Channel Redundancy               | 62.5 bps Max    | FEC             |
