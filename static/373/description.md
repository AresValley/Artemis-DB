Panther-H is an intelligent frequency hopping transceiver developed by Racal (now Thales Group). Has a signature 8-burst SOC (Start Of Conversation) sync procedure.

This transceiver, when in frequency hopping mode, will begin with the 8-burst SOC. After a SOC, the modem will begin sending data using frequency hopping, typically covering a bandwidth of 64kHz, 128kHz, or 256kHz, but it can cover up to 2 MHz. The SOC bursts each last 95ms, and the data bursts in freq hopping mode last about 121ms each. The SOC bursts stay on the same frequency for 8 bursts; they don't frequency hop. Frequency hopping begins when a connection is established between two parties and data begins to transmit.

The modem uses QPSK at 2400 Bd. For frequency hopping, the standard speed is 10 hops/s.
