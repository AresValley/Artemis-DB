CIS-3000 is an 8-PSK Data Modem protocol. Its source is traced to Russia. 3000 is for its 3000 Baud speed (maximum speed is technically 9000 bps).

CIS-3000 has been seen acting like 2G ALE, where it has been seen to prelude CIS-128 transmissions and CIS MFSK-68 transmissions like a calling mode.

Data on this signal is found in Roland Proesch's Technical Handbook for Radio Monitoring HF.
