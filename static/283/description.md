Logic Trunked Radio, is an analog trunked radio format developed by EF Johnson Company.
Unlike most Trunked radio formats, including analog variants such as Passport, MPT1327, etc. LTR does not have a control channel. However, each repeater has its own controller and is required to report to a master controller.
