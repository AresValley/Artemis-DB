JS8Call (JS8) is an amateur radio QSO communication mode based on FT8. It is popular among amateur radio operators for its ability to send and receive messages despite challenging propagation conditions, high noise environments, low power operations (QRP), or even compromised antennas.

JS8Call turns FT8 into a "chat" mode, allowing stations to send longer messages "keyboard-to-keyboard." JS8Call can be thought of like a very weak-signal radio broadcast form of 'e-mail' (though it is not e-mail), where operators can check their message inbox and reply later. Messages can also be sent out to be relayed through other operators to reach a recipient operator. JS8Call conversations can also be had in real-time.

JS8Call was created by Jordan Sherer (KN4CRD) and first released January 04, 2019. Later releases of JS8Call added more features to the mode, such as higher-speed transmissions.

# Frequencies
"From version . 0.5.x the default calling frequencies set up in JS8Call are listed below, but please note these are not set in stone and can easily be changed in your settings, or you can simply manually retune your radio to another frequency." JS8Call is designed as an HF mode, but (as with any amateur radio mode) can also be used on VHF/UHF if desired.
