ALIS-2, also known as RS-ARQ, RS ARQ 240, and MERLIN, is an improvement of the original ALIS system. ALIS-2 is used in the Rohde & Schwarz MERLIN modem. This mode has been used most frequently by Turkish, German and Italian diplomatic stations. The Italian diplomatic stations seem to favor the 5 bit (ITA2) mode. Turkish diplomatic stations have been found using the 8 bit mode for all traffic.

ALIS-2 is described in the "Report of the CCIR 1990, Fixed Service at Frequencies below about 30 MHz" of the ITU.

# Characteristics
ALIS-2 was developed by Rohde & Schwarz, the same company that developed the original ALIS. ALIS-2 uses an 8-FSK burst mode running at 240.82Bd (720 bits/s). The spacing between tones is 240Hz. Each tone has a duration of 4.15254 ms every burst.

When the system is found in the 7 tone mode it is in ISS mode, the IRS mode uses an 8 tone signal.
