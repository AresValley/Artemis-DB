FST4 is a 4-GFSK extreme weak-signal amateur radio communications mode, designed especially for the MF and LF bands. It is part of the WSJT-X software. Like other WSJT-X modes such as FT8, it carriers only the minimal amount of information for making contacts (QSO's).

FST4 uses 4-GFSK modulation and can use 15, 30, 60, 120, 300, 900 and 1800-second transmit/receive slots. The slowest and most sensitive submode FST4-1800 is theoretically decodable with signal-to-noise ratio down to -43.2 dB, but it requires high frequency stability for the transmitter and the receiver, and small Doppler spread - all these should stay smaller than 0.089 Hz during one transmission.

Due to the very small tone spacing of the slower FST4 submodes, they can be easily mistaken for interference or spurious emissions when heard or seen on a waterfall display.

## Frequencies
FST4 is designed for LF and MF frequency ranges and the most likely bands to find it are the 2200-meter and 630-meter bands.
