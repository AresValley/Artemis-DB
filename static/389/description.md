This signal originates from the Silicon Instruments Si1000 Software Defined Radio (SDR) that is a component of the 3DR Telemetry Radio, sold for use as a data link between a computer ground station and a UAV "a drone".

It is typically sold configured for use on one of three ISM bands (433, 868, 915 MHz) However, as it is an SDR, a licenced radio amateur may set it to operate on other frequencies, and adjust the power level. You may see this signal in different forms on many bands, as the Si1000 SOC Radio is used for MANY MANY different applications. Shown in the image is only the default configuration for FHSS-TDM. This SDR can be programmed to send its telemetry (or other) data using BPSK, 8-PSK, and QAM at various constellation sizes.

Note that these values and uses are only in reference to the Si1000's minor use as a toy helicopter radio, the Si1000 and similar chips are not only highly adaptive but have the possibility of having custom, novel modulation schemes created by the end user(s). As such this chip and others of the same type or better now have uses such as Passive RADAR and Long Range Telemetry, Even Active RADAR in the hands of the general population. SDR SoC's have found military use for at least twice the time the public has been aware of them, as a consequence, mature integrated radio systems and technologies are flooding the market (one can purchase an SDR with a USB port and 2.8 MHz bandwidth for US$10)
