GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications, originally Groupe Spécial Mobile), is a standard developed by ETSI to describe the protocols for second-generation (2G) digital cellular networks used by mobile phones, first deployed in Finland in July 1991. As of 2014 it has become the default global standard for mobile communications - with over 90% market share, operating in over 219 countries and territories. As the need for more low-band 5G and 4G networks grow, operators around the world began phasing out GSM to re-farm spectrum. In the U.S, AT&T shut down GSM in 2017 while T-Mobile GSM continues to operate until 2024. In Australia, Optus GSM was decommissioned in 2017.
