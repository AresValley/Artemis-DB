Continuous Tone-Coded Squelch System (CTCSS) is a low continuous tone transmitted on NFM voice transmissions that is used to squelch and manage transmissions on a given frequency. This is also known as Private Line® (PL) by Motorola, Channel Guard® (CG) by General Electric and generically as tone squelch. The CTCSS system sounds like a low hum to listeners.

CTCSS is used in many analog FM public safety radios. They have a characteristic look on the waterfall, as continuous lines emanating around the center frequency carrier.
