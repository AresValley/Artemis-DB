Can be seen with either 50 or 100 Bd, as well as shifts of 85, 125, 200, 250 and 500 Hz, variable 50-3500 Bd. Often uses shift of 200 and 250 Hz and 50 Baud. In addition, Idle dot reversals are transmitted at 50 Bd, followed by traffic in 50 baud (more rarely in 100 Baud). Can be found on frequencies of Russian Navy.
