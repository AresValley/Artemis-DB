Meteosat WEFAX is the original WEFAX implementation used to transmit satellite images via Meteosat Satellites. WEFAX was introduced with the first Meteosat in 1977. Meteosat WEFAX uses an AM 2.4 kHz carrier signal modulated with a 1.6 kHz video signal.

# Characteristics
WEFAX is a standard data transmission specification used by operators of geostationary meteorological satellites to transmit satellite images and other data in analogue form to low-cost user stations. The format is a derivative of the Automatic Picture Transmission (APT) originally developed for transmission from the polar satellites of the USA.

# Frequencies
The international standard broadcast frequency for satellite WEFAX transmissions is 1691,0 MHz. Some systems, such as EUMETSATâ€™s METEOSAT, also transmits WEFAX on 1694,5 MHz.

The composite audio signal is frequency modulated (FM) onto 1691.0 MHz (Channel A1) and 1694.5 MHz (Channel A2) carriers.
