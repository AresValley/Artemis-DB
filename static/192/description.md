Global Maritime Distress and Safety System's Digital Selective Calling System is a maritime communication protocol using FSK, quite similar to SITOR and used on VHF, MF and HF marine bands. The full description of the protocol is described in ITU document M-493.

This mode is derived from the CCIR 493-4 Selcall format.
