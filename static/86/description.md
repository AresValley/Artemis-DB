CIS-1280 is an OQPSK (Offset Quadrature Phase Shift-Keying) modulation data modem signal. Also known as Soviet Mil(MOD)/FAPSI/PTT system. These stations are recognizable in that they are all placed on .081 offsets from a kilohertz or half kilohertz point.

OQPSK means the width of the signal is exactly equal to the speed of the signal, which in this case is 1280 bps.

Data on this signal is found in Roland Proesch's Technical Handbook for Radio Monitoring HF.
