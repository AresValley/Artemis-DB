Ionospheric Scattering (ISCAT) mode used for weak signal long distance radio contact by meteor and Ionosphere scattering.

ISCAT has two sub-modes: ISCAT-B and ISCAT-A. ISCAT-B is the original ISCAT mode with total bandwidth 1809 Hz. ISCAT-A runs at half the rate, uses half the bandwidth, and (for average decodes on steady signals) is about 1 dB more sensitive.
