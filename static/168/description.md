Transmits train telemetry such as brake status and accidental separation information to the head locomotive.

ETD devices monitor functions such as brake line pressure and accidental separation of the train using a motion sensor, functions that were previously monitored by a crew in the caboose. The ETD transmits the data via a telemetry link to the Head-of-Train Device (HTD) in the locomotive.

# Characteristics
Uses 1200 baud FSK.

# Frequencies
ETD's in North America operate on the 452.9375/457.9375 MHz frequency pair, with the EOT Device on the higher frequency and the locomotive engine on the lower.

Australia's Pacific National rail freight locomotives use 477.7 MHz for EOT and 472.5 MHz for HOT.

New Zealand operates on 450.2625 MHz for both it's HOT and EOTD, due to the railway layout in New Zealand, a DPU is not used.
