Commercial Broadcast FM radio stations. Used for the broadcast of many different radio programs, including music, news, sports, weather, and talk shows.

Bandwidth for Mono FM is 19 kHz, with a stereo stream it raises up to 54 kHz, if there is RDS the bandwidth is 59 kHz, and if DARC is present it is 92 kHz.

There are a number of variations on the subcarriers that are placed on some FM Broadcast channels. RDS (RBDS in North America), and DARC are some of the data-based subcarriers used to transmit information alongside the FM broadcast. The information includes station name, details of current programming, alerts, traffic information, and more. Broadcasting in stereo FM also uses subcarriers for left and right channels.

In addition, in North America, HD Radio by iBiquity (Now part of DTS) in-band on-channel (IBOC) digital radio technology is broadcast on the outer sidebands of some FM radio stations. They have a distinctive look, two plateaus flanking the main FM analog signal.
