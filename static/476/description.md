The Total Access Communication System (TACS) was an analogue cellular voice communications system. It was introduced to the United Kingdom in 1982 before expanding to Europe, Hong Kong and a few countries in the Middle East.

Signalling (for connecting voice and data calls) was conducted using FSK at a speed of 8 kbit/s.

Extended TACS (ETACS) was introduced to expand the allocated spectrum to increase the amount of available channels.

TACS and ETACS were discontinued in the UK in 2001, and cellular services have been replaced by GSM.
