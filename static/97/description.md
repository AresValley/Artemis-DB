CLOUDSAT is a NASA satellite with a single instrument, a CPR (Cloud Profiling Radar) that operates at 94 GHz to create a vertical sounding (cross section) of the atmosphere (as opposed to most satellites that provide horizontal profiles)

It dumps in S-band to a European ground station 12 orbits worth of data.
