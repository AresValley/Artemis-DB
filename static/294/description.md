Popular antenna analyzer among ham operators and the like. Output power is only ~20mW so if heard, source is nearby. Other MFJ models may be similar.

MFJ's line of antenna analyzers are extremely popular due in part to their simplicity and ease of use. One feature is the ability to attach an antenna and get a rough idea of its center frequency and usable bandwidth among other things. This necessitates the injection of a small signal in order to make these measurements that may be heard nearby.
