Convergent Digital Radio (CDR), also known as China Digital Radio (CDR), is an In-Band On-Channel (IBOC) digital radio broadcasting standard that operates in the FM band (88 MHz to 108 MHz). It is also known as ITU Digital System H.

CDR is a flexible system that may be configured to suit different bandwidth requirements. ITU-R recommendation BS.1114-12 allows for 6 configurations which allows for digital only operation (Modes A, B) or may flank analog signals in an IBOC configuration (Modes C-F). CDR is a OFDM system that allows for simultaneous delivery of multiple audio and data streams. CDR uses frequency-time interleaving and LDPC forward error correction to improve performance against multipath and interference. Furthermore, the system may be configured with different OFDM transmission modes, modulations including QPSK, 16-QAM or 64-QAM, and LDPC rates to allow for various net bitrates. This system uses, but is not limited to, the DRA+ audio codec.
