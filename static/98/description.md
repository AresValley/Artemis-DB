CLOVER 2000 is an upgrade to CLOVER-II, a digital data protocol developed by Ray Petit and HAL Communications. Sometimes referred to as XCLOVER or 8 Tone CLOVER. CLOVER-2000 was introduced in 1999 by HAL Communications. CLOVER 2000 is 4 times as fast as CLOVER-II, and carries over all of the error correction algorithms from the original CLOVER-II.

CLOVER-2000 uses 8 250 Hz wide tone-pulse subcarriers that are each offset from the base tone by 2ms, so that every 16ms all eight tone pulses transmit their cycle. CLOVER-2000 uses Phase (PSK) or Phase-Amplitude (Circular QAM) shift keying modulation. CLOVER-2000 occupies 2 kHz of bandwidth in contrast to CLOVER-II's 500 Hz of bandwidth. The symbol rate for CLOVER-2000 is always 62.5 bd for all modes, double the symbol rate of CLOVER-II.
