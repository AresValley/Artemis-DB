The GOES Rebroadcast (GRB) data is a set of data products broadcasted from the GOES-R series of satellites that contains information from all of its on-board instruments. The data contains imagery and info from the Advanced Baseline Imager, the Solar Ultraviolet Imager, as well as the standard HRIT data.

The signal is broadcasted as a DVB-S2 (Digital Video Broadcast, standard 2) signal modulated as both QPSK and 8PSK, with forward error corrections of 2/3 and 9/10. The sample rate is around 7.8-8.6 Million samples per second.

The dish size recommended for RF data reception is 2m-5m.

An example of all GOES data can be found on NOAA's website

The images in the GRB data are also quite frequent with very little amounts of filler data.
