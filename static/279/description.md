This is the UHF band variant of Link-11, which is transmitted on a FM carrier. The FM-demodulated baseband is identical to the original Link-11 waveform used on MF and HF bands. See the Link-11 page for in-depth details on the underlying waveform characteristics.

Link-11 UHF has many of the same characteristics as the original underlying Link-11 waveform, including the characteristic sound pattern. The UHF variant, which is FM-modulated, is about 30 kHz wide in bandwidth. Each of the short ACK/ARQ bursts are about 125ms long, with the data payload duration being variable.

When FM-demodulated, the waveform is equivalent to that of Link-11 on the MF and HF bands.
