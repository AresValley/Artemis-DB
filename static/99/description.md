CLOVER 2500 is a new upgrade to CLOVER 2000, adding 25% more speed to the CLOVER system. CLOVER-2500 was released in 2011 by HAL Communications.

CLOVER-2500 uses 8 312.5 Hz wide tone-pulse subcarriers that are each offset from the base tone by 1.6ms, so that every 12.8ms all eight tone pulses transmit their cycle. CLOVER-2500 uses Phase (PSK) or Phase-Amplitude (Circular QAM) shift keying modulation. CLOVER-2500 occupies 2.5 kHz of bandwidth in contrast to CLOVER-2000's 2000 Hz of bandwidth. The symbol rate for CLOVER-2500 is increased to 78.125 Bd for all modes, 25% faster than CLOVER-2000's 62.5 Bd.
