The High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) is an ionospheric research program conducted at the HAARP Research Station at Gakona, Alaska. In 2014 the HAARP program was shut down and in August 2015, the ownership was transferred from the USAF to The University of Alaska Fairbanks. HAARP reopened as of early 2017 for independent researcher use.

HAARP was opened in 1993, costing US$300 million, and was operating under the United States Air Force along with the US Navy, DARPA, and the University of Alaska. The primary purpose of HAARP was to study, analyze and conduct experiments on ionospheric behavior for improving our understanding of the earth's ionosphere as well as enhancing technology for RF communications.

The primary instrument at the HAARP facility is the Ionospheric Research Instrument (IRI), a high power 180-antenna strong phased array transmitter that can transmit between 2.7 MHz and 10 MHz at a maximum effected radiated power (ERP) of 5.1 Gigawatts, or 97.1 dBW. The waveforms found by shortwave listeners from HAARP all came from the IRI.

HAARP almost never directly transmits signals in the VLF/ELF frequency range. The signals are generated in the ionosphere at an altitude of around 100 km, and "bounce back" to RF. Some exceptions include studying polar mesospheric summer echoes using radars on 49 MHz and 139 MHz.

In April 2021, it was announced that a five-year, $9.3 million National Science Foundation grant will allow the University of Alaska Fairbanks Geophysical Institute to establish a new research observatory dedicated to exploring Earth’s upper atmosphere and geospace environment. This grant will allow scientists to investigate how the sun affects Earth’s ionosphere and magnetosphere to produce changes in space weather. The IRI will be the centerpiece of this newly founded observatory.

# Samples
HAARP uses a wide variety of waveforms during its operation. One is a sweeping CW wave that linearly increases or decreases. Another waveform are constant CW tones that increment up/down at select frequencies from the center carrier. There are still other waveforms including fast carrier pulsing, slow carrier pulses, ionosonde-like sweeps, OTH radar-like waveforms, unmodulated carriers, and combinations of these together selectivity at a time.

In addition, HAARP can also operate as a pseudo-radar, transmitting very short pulses or long pulses. At one time it even transmitted Morse code that was intentionally bounced off the Moon for radio hobbyists to hear.
