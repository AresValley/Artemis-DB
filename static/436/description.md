SWED-ARQ, also known as ARQ-SWE, was a Swedish simplex ARQ system used by Swedish diplomatic services. This protocol supported three packet lengths and was able to change packet length mid-transmission. No longer used today.

SWED-ARQ had 400 Hz Shift and typically ran at 100 Bd. The three packet lengths it used are:

- 3 character block, 210 ms
- 9 character block, 630 ms
- 22 character block, 1540 ms

For all three packet lengths, the time between packets is 240 ms. When SWED-ARQ is running at 3 character block packet size, it is identical to SITOR-A.
