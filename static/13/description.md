IEEE 802.11n-2009, commonly shortened to 802.11n, is a wireless-networking standard that uses multiple antennas to increase data rates. The Wi-Fi Alliance has also retroactively labelled the technology for the standard as Wi-Fi 4. It standardized support for multiple-input multiple-output, frame aggregation, and security improvements, among other features, and can be used in the 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz frequency bands.

The signal file corresponds to a Wi-Fi signal captured directly above the router, the signaling beacon can be heard. 0:00 to 0:14: Daily use, low transfer. 0:15 to end: Full bandwidth usage @ 113mbps.
