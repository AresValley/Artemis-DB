LoRa (Long Range) is a proprietary low-power wide-area network modulation technique. It is based on spread-spectrum modulation techniques derived from chirp spread spectrum (CSS) technology. LoRa enables long-range transmissions with low power consumption. The technology covers the physical layer, while other technologies and protocols such as LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) cover the upper layers. It can achieve data rates between 0.3 kbit/s and 27 kbit/s depending upon the spreading factor.
