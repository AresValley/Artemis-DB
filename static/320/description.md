Motorola ASTRO 25 High Performance Data (HPD) uses the HPD Air Interface (HAI) to communicate with compatible modems. The modems are used primarily by law enforcement mobile data terminals to communicate with a dispatch center's computer-aided dispatch system. Downlink channels strongly resemble iDEN. The downlink uses four QAM channels packed closely together to occupy a 25 kHz channel, and the uplink uses TDMA. Short blips can be heard on the uplink, and they may not resemble the downlink signal. The downlink signal has a 120ms ACF with other peaks on multiples of 30ms, and the uplink signal has an ACF that is a multiple of 30ms (usually 180ms, 360ms, or 420ms).

Most HPD systems use Motorola HPD 1000 modems for subscriber units and Motorola GTR 8000 transmitters for base stations.

# Frequencies
In the United States, downlinks are found in the 769-775 MHz and 851-869 MHz ranges, and uplinks use standard +30 MHz or -45 MHz splits, respectively.
