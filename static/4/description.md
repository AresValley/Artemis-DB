The Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS) was developed in 1978, and released to the public in 1983 by Bell Laboratories to cater for increased demand of mobile voice services.

FSK signalling was used to connect mobile customers to the base station to place voice calls, this data was transmitted at 10 kbit/s. Voice data was transmitted over NFM analog modulation.

As the number of subscribers increased, some 30 kHz analog voice channels were converted to D-AMPS channels which could service more users using TDMA, at the cost of reduced voice quality.

The technology saw use in many other countries such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Pakistan and Spain. However many other countries had created their own systems (Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT), for example).

In the 1990s, telecommunications companies worldwide started phasing out AMPS services in favour of the improved GSM standard, which provided encryption and data services.

# Frequencies
The FCC had originally allocated 40 MHz of spectrum between 830 MHz and 870 Mhz, which allowed for 666 voice channel pairs spaced 30 kHz apart.

This range was expanded to 824-894 MHz to accommodate more voice channels. The frequencies were previously used for UHF analog TV broadcasting.
