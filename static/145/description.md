dPMR is an open, non-proprietary trunked radio standard developed by ETSI, published under ETSI TS 102 658. Supports both data and digital voice transmission.

dPMR uses FDMA of 6.25 kHz bandwidth with a raw data rate of 4800 bps (user data rate: 3600 bps). dPMR uses 4FSK at 2400 Bd. The dibits are mapped to +/-1050 Hz and +/-350 Hz from the center frequency.

Because the emission mask is so tight, two 6.25 kHz dPMR signals can be used next to each other within a 12.5 kHz channel without causing interference to each other or adjacent channels
