PSK-AM is an amateur digital mode developed by Patrick Lindecker F6CTE in 2002/2003, and incorporates FEC interleaving. PSK-AM uses the modulation of PSK10/31 with the FEC of SITOR-B. each character is transmitted twice at an interval of five characters (example: A * B * C A D B E Câ€¦).

There are three speed modes for PSK-AM. PSK-AM 10, PSK-AM 31, and PSK-AM 50. All three use DBPSK.

- PSK-AM 10 transmits at 10 Bd, ~40 Hz bandwidth.
- PSK-AM 31 transmits at 31 Bd, ~110 Hz bandwidth.
- PSK-AM 50 transmits at 50 Bd, ~180 Hz bandwidth
