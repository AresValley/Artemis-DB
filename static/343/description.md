The Nokia Adaptive Message Terminal, also known as Nokia Adaptive Burst Modem, is a Finnish encrypted messaging system suggested to be used by Finnish Intelligence Services.

Used by Swedish military under the name Kryapp 302 (kryptoapparat, krypteringsapparat). Colloquially known as MGK and MGKI, or just "Kalle" for short.

Swedish military seems to have the following inventory codes for devices with that name:

- M3858-302011 KRYAPP 302 MT1
- M3858-302012 KRYAPP 302 MT2
- M3858-302021 KRYAPP 302 PC /T1
- M3858-302022 KRYAPP 302 PC /T2
- M3858-302111 KRYAPP 3021 /T

In photos the Swedish model has Nokia Data labels over it and it looks quite similar to the Finnish Partiosanomalaite (PARSA) with a QWERTY keyboard, LED dot matrix display and a six AA battery container with the door on the left side. MGK has a four-row keyboard and a speaker next to the display; a PARSA only has three rows. Also, the location and type of external connectors seems to differ. Not sure about the software and interior. The 300 baud signal samples might be originating from Sweden, because Finnish SANLA/PARSA devices only offer 600 and 150 baud options to the end user.
