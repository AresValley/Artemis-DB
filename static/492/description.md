VOICE is a MFSK mode developed by Patrick Lindecker F6CTE in 2006, and was derived from Olivia. It was designed for blind or partially sighted amateur radio operators where all received characters can be pronounced.

VOICE was derived from the 8 tone, 62.5 baud Olivia mode, but with a 32 bit vector instead of a 64 bit vector, a different set of characters and a different speed.

VOICE uses 8MFSK with a shift of 21 Hz between tones. VOICE runs at 21 Bd, 20 wpm. VOICE uses a limited ASCII character set of 61 usable characters. The minimum ratio Signal-to-Noise ratio is about - 14.5 dB which makes it very sensitive and takes up only 200 Hz of bandwidth.
