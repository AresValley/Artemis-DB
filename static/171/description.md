European Radio Message System (ERMES) is a European common standard for paging developed by ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute) in 1990. By 1996, ERMES became operational.

ERMES used to use 16 channels in its frequency of operation, but since 2006 this had been reduced to 8 channels.

The modulation method is 4-FSK at 6.25 kbit/s (3125 symbols/sec).

# Frequencies
ERMES was allocated in the frequency range 169.4125 MHz-169.8325 MHz.

# Deallocation
By 1999, it was decided that the 169.4-169.8 MHz frequency band would no longer be reserved for the sole use of ERMES.

As quoted from an EU Commission report in 2005:

"The use of the 169,4 to 169,8 MHz radio spectrum band for ERMES in the Community has decreased dramatically or even ceased altogether, with the result that this radio spectrum band is not being efficiently utilised by ERMES and could therefore be better used to fulfil other Community policy needs...The use of this radio spectrum band for ERMES has remained very limited and that the need for radio messaging or paging systems has changed in Europe as the functions thereof have been replaced by other technologies such as short messaging systems (SMS) over GSM."
