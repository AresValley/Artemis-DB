MIL-STD-188-110 Appendix A is a 16-tone OFDM PSK signal used to transmit data. As of 110C revision, this mode is being phased out. However it is still used in the US during Armed Forces Day.

PSK signals are superseding these lesser-performing signals.

A 605 Hz pilot tone is sometimes used for doppler correction. The preamble has both 605 Hz and 1705 Hz umodulated tones used to sync the modem so it may receive the signal clearly. Uses a 75 Hz baud rate in each channel. Uses BPSK for 75, 150, 300, and 600bps (135 and 315 degrees, to remain the same as DQPSK's phases), and uses DQPSK for 1200 and 2400bps.
