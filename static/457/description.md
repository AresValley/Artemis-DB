T-230-1A Маховик (Mahovik), "Flywheel" in Russian, is a PSK based mode that can transmit both voice and data. It is transmitted from a Russian T-230-1A radio transceiver. From the signal, it seems to support at least BPSK modulation.

The current invasion of Ukraine has spawned several of these signals.
