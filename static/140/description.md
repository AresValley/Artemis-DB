Digital Dispatch Systems MDT is a dispatching system used by taxi and private transportation companies. Data transmitted on this data link include MDT usage, credit card information (encrypted), GPS location, and general dispatching activities. Uses a 4800 bps QPSK signal running at 2400 baud. When idle (no data transmitting), it repeats a ~43Bd idle pattern. Data can be heard in very short bursts.
