The Modernised High Frequency Communications System (MHFCS) is an Australian Department of Defense HF System for their military communications network. Also known as AUS MIL ISB Modem, AUS MHFCS, and ADF MHFCS. This system was initiated as the High Frequency Modernization Project.

The purpose of the High Frequency (HF) Modernisation Project (JP 2043) is to "provide the Australian Defense Forces (ADF) with a secure, cost-effective information exchange capability for the command and control of deployed forces as a primary survivable system and as a parallel system to satellite communications".

# Characteristics
As reported in the November 8 2018 logs in the UDXF by Eddy Walters of Australia, Australian Defence Force have changed their previous dual channel system to two single channel with 4 kHz spacings. The lower of the 2 frequencies has a speed of 600 baud, while the higher is 50 baud. The shift in both cases in 850 Hz.

Previously, MHFCS's normal mode of operation is USB voice channels for use with the Australian Defense Force, primarily on the Voice Contact Nets (VCN). MHFCS also has digital modes used for sending encrypted data. Apart from ALE and ANDVT, the digital mode used in this system is an ISB modulated FSK mode. ISB (Independent Sideband Modulation) is when a signal modulates two independent sidebands, a USB and an LSB, that is independent of each other. This allows one type of signal on one sideband, and another type on the other sideband.

In ISB mode, this system has been seen transmitting a pair of signals together. One 340Hz shift 600bd FSK on LSB, and 340Hz shift 50bd FSK on USB. The 600Bd signal has roughly 750 Hz of bandwidth, where the 50Bd signal has about 400Hz of bandwidth. The total bandwidth given the two independent signals would be ~3.4 kHz, which includes the space between the two FSK signals. The shift between the two FSK signals is about 2750 Hz.

The 2 sidebands evidently have names, per Eddy Walters. The USB side is called Rockwell 700B while the LSB is called Rockwell CPU100. The actual significance of these names remains a mystery.
