ROS is an amateur radio teletype free running QSO mode designed for low signal/high noise conditions. ROS was designed by José Alberto Nieto Ros EA5HVK.

ROS implements a combination of FHSS (Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum), DSSS (Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum) and 2G (Second Generation) CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access), The modem deployed's a 144 MFSK phase continuous single tone, modulation scheme, ROS may be amplified by non-linear Tx path. Class c/d/e.

The unique deployment of 2G technology, similar to mobile phones, allows multiple simultaneous access to a single channel. The provision of the ‘decode from’ function, providing selection of a single call-sign only for RX,A QSO may take place, isolated from the channel traffic, at the rated sensitivity for the selected speed, similar to the connected state of a packet QSO.

ROS provides efficient use of channel capacity and Data rate/power ratio and is exceptionally robust, being well suited to QRP Dx, low power chat and disturbed paths, i.e., Polar and NVIS 5 MHz, where conventional data modes are unable to provide communication's.

# History
The ROS project has evolved, with various modes and options being added and deleted, uniquely modes are linked to bands

- 1 baud experimental HF 2.2 kHz HF FHSS MFSK
- VHF EME Mode, 50 Hz B/W MFSK Live chat mode for 145 MHz EME, 1500Hz AFC lock range
- 2000 Hz and 500 Hz b/w ROS-HF
- ROS Repeater, Providing on-channel and /or CAT control cross band repeater
- ROS MF1 and MF7 Data modes, 100Hz B/W Developed during the UK 500 NOV
- ROS MF2 and MF7 Full chr's set, MF2 same s/n as wspr 2, live rtty chat mode, MF7, same rate as psk32, -10 db lower s/n
- ROS Remote configuration for Beacon sites
- ROS Remote access, allowing remote web access to full Tx/Rx functions
- ROS Text delivery, allowing SMS messages to be routed to other users
- ROS Wide-Hop Base Band FHSS Concept mode developed [ only data mode to continue working on 10MHz when band jammed by OTH radar]
- The latest version, provides only ROS-2K 4/8/16 Modes

In Keeping with the theme of constant development, Version 7-4-0 upgrade release 9/11/2016, introduced changes to modulation code structure, providing enhancements to print quality in marginal band conditions . Previous Versions to V7-4-0 are not compatible with the new coding.
