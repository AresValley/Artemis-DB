Swedish navy transmitter for submarine communication. It shares the antenna with SAQ (Grimeton Radio).

Swedish MSK transmitters can easily be identified in the waterfall diagram by their fishbone-like modulation pattern. This seems to belong to the idle phases where no data are transmitted.

The fishbone pattern is even audible as a characteristic modulation.
