The ELEKTRO-L series of geostationary weather satellites carry a cosmic ray detector called GGAK-E (Гелио Геофизический Aппаратурный Kомплекс = Helio-geophysical Instrumentation Complex) to monitor solar wind, cosmic rays and radiation levels.

The data is broadcast over an L-band link at 1693 MHz. Very little is known about the link or the instrument.
