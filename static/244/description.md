IsatM2M Paging Service was operated by Inmarsat on (then) existing Inmarsat-D/D+ infrastructure. It was used for transport vehicle security, industrial equipment monitoring (SCADA) and marine tracking. Similar waveform to Inmarsat-D/D+ but employs faster bit rate and wider bandwidth.

32-MFSK, 16 symbols/sec, 32 Hz shift. ~80 bps max data rate. Has idling mode and preamble. Compared to the Inmarsat-D/D+ waveform, IsatM2M is 2-4x faster, with maximum data rate of 80 bps (compared with Inmarsat-D/D+'s maximum datarate of 20-40 bps).

Inmarsat withdrew M2M from service on the 31st of December 2021, replacing it with IsatData Pro.
