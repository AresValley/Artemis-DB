The Japanese Slot Machine (Enigma Designation XSL) is a simplex system used by the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force in Ichihara, Japan. This signal is transmitted from the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force Ichihara Transmitting Station (海上自衛隊市原送信所) in Ichihara, Japan. Uses QPSK at 1500 Bd to transmit. Has a very interesting and unique idling format which sounds akin to a slot machine, hence the attributed name. This modem has been active since 2001.
