Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) is a Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) radio technology standard developed by 3GPP to enable a wide range of cellular devices and services. The specification was frozen in 3GPP Release 13 (LTE Advanced Pro), in June 2016. Other 3GPP IoT technologies include eMTC (enhanced Machine-Type Communication) and EC-GSM-IoT


NB-IoT focuses specifically on indoor coverage, low cost, long battery life, and high connection density. NB-IoT uses a subset of the LTE standard, but limits the bandwidth to a single narrow-band of 200kHz. It uses OFDM modulation for downlink communication and SC-FDMA for uplink communications.

There are three primary configurations in which NB-IoT can be deployed: inband, guardband, and standalone. In the inband configuration, NB-IoT is located within the LTE carrier, utilizing a single resource block. Alternatively, NB-IoT can be deployed in the guardband configuration, where it is situated between or aside LTE carriers. Finally, NB-IoT can also be deployed in a standalone operation, where it is located in a frequency band without any LTE carriers, such as near GSM carriers.

In March 2019, the Global Mobile Suppliers Association announced that over 100 operators have deployed/launched either NB-IoT or LTE-M networks. This number had risen to 142 deployed/launched networks by September 2019.
