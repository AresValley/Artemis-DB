DUP-ARQ, also known as ARTRAC and 125-ARTRAC, is a semi-duplex ARQ system once used by Thai and Hungarian Diplomatic services.

Baud rate is typically 125 bd at 170 Hz shift using ITA-2. If a DUP-ARQ system detects interference it will change frequency in 400 Hz steps (See DUP-ARQ ALE sample below). If a 3kHz channel is full of interference the system will select another frequency.
