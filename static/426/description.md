SPREAD, also known as AUTOSPEC Mk2, SPREAD-11, SPREAD-21, and SPREAD-51, was a FEC system used by Romanian diplomatic stations and the Brazilian Navy and shore stations. SPREAD is considered the successor to AUTOSPEC, and like AUTOSPEC, used the 10-bit Bauer code. SPREAD is named so because it spreads bits after the 10-bit bauer code.

Three variants of SPREAD exist, SPREAD-11, SPREAD-21, and SPREAD-51.

- For SPREAD-11, after each bit of the 10-bit Bauer code, 10 data bits from other characters are sent.
- For SPREAD-21, after each bit of the 10-bit Bauer code, 20 data bits from other characters are sent.
- For SPREAD-51, after each bit of the 10-bit Bauer code, 50 data bits from other characters are sent.
The spreading of bits helps to improve the data transfer reliability.

SPREAD uses a 410 Hz FSK shift, and had been mostly seen at 68.5 Bd, 102.7 Bd and 137 Bd with 218 Bd seen seldomly.
