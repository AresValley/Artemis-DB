The **All-Sky Interferometric Meteor Radar** or **SKiYMET**, is a meteor detection radar, developed by Genesis Software and MARDOC Inc., and operated by many research institutes around the world.

The SKiYMET radar can operate on the high HF and low VHF bands. It transmits a pulsed signal and can use different pulse repetition frequencies (PRF). A characteristic feature is the spectrum which shows side lobes around the main lobe when the signal is strong. Because of this, it is hard to determine bandwidth. Width of the main lobe can be tens of kHz but when the side lobes are counted it can be more than 100 kHz or 200 kHz and over 1 MHz has also been stated. Under normal propagation conditions, SKiYMET usually can't be received beyond line of sight, but special propagation modes such as sporadic-E sometimes allow reception much further away. Using sensitive equipment, it may also be possible to receive signal reflections from meteors.

The sample shown here was spotted in northern Europe on 29th of June 2024 during good sporadic E conditions, on 36.2 MHz. It uses a 625 Hz pulse frequency. Based on these parameters it is the SKiYMET radar in Collm, Germany. Bandwidth is more than 100 kHz but it's hard to determine accurately as the spectrum edges are smooth and the spectrum forms "lobes" as can be seen in the picture.
