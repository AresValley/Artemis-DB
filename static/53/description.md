The Automatic Vehicle Monitoring (AVM) system was implemented on Melbourne's public Bus and Tram network in the 1980s. It is primarily used to track and control vehicles, and facilitates PTT-ID for communication with tram drivers.

There are five fleet controllers (see frequencies) which send a poll to each vehicle every 10 seconds, and the tram will transmit its current location, route, distance, speed, door status, alarms along with some other data, including odometer information on the uplink frequency.

Since 2009 the AVM data feeds the PIDs at tram stops and stations, as well as the TramTracker app for mobile devices.
