SNOTEL stations are a set of precipitation and other sensors spread across the mountains of the United States by the United States Department of Agriculture through the National Resources Conservation Service. The SNOTEL website can be found here and includes a map of all of the stations.

The signal itself uses very short bursts of BPSK data at 4000 bits per second. Since the stations are in remote locations, sometimes in deep mountain valleys, they use meteor scatter propagation to best get their data back to a base station.
