EIA is a 5/6 tone selcall mode defined by the Electronics Industries Association in the United States. Also known as Motorola MetroPage.

Selcall (selective calling) is a type of squelch protocol used in radio communications systems, in which transmissions include a brief burst of sequential audio tones. Receivers that are set to respond to the transmitted tone sequence will open their squelch, while others will remain muted.

EIA has 15 tones to choose from, but only sends bursts of up to 5 or 6 tones. Each tone has a duration of 33 ms per tone. The bursts transmit right before a radio transmission.
