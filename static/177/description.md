FSK441 is a high speed meteor scatter communication mode. FSK441 uses a baud rate of 441 Bd. Maximum propagation distance: 2,250 km

Transmitting FSK441 is designed to transmit the same message over and over to give the signals a chance to bounce off of a good meteor coming through the atmosphere.

When receiving FSK441 from distant operators, the signals will come in at varying burst lengths of varying strength. Some can be as long as 10 seconds, and as short as a few hundred milliseconds.

FSK441 is generally used on the 2-meter and 70-centimeter amateur bands.
