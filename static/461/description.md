TT2300, also known as TT2300B, TT2300-ARQ, TRA-2300, and TPLEX, is an 8MFSK synchronous system developed by Thrane & Thrane of Denmark (acquired by UK defense firm Cobham in 2012). TT2300 was used by French diplomatic services, UK Civil Aviation Authority (National Air Traffic System/NATS datalink, Prestwick/Reykjavik), and Algerian oil companies. Thrane & Thrane's name for this protocol/coding is TPLEX, not to be confused with TWINPLEX.

# Characteristics
TT2300 runs at 100 Bd (300 bps) or 200 Bd (600 bps) and uses 8-bit ASCII encoding. Each of the 8 tones uses 200 Hz spacing for ~1600-1700 Hz bandwidth.

TT2300 looks and sounds very similar to 2G ALE at 100 Bd. To distinguish, TT2300 has an ACF of ~320 ms for both 100 Bd and 200 Bd.
