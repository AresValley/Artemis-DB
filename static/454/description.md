SuperDARN (Super Dual Auroral Radar Network, sometimes known as The Grasshopper) is an international radar network used for scientific purposes. The network is used to study plasma convection in the upper atmosphere. All worldwide sites are operated by various research organizations and universities.

The SuperDARN radars operate between 8-22 MHz and have directional transmissions. It can often be identified by its characteristic "scalloped" shaped signal and its "crunchy" sound when listened to with AM or USB.

As of April 2020, there are 36 sites worldwide that operate as part of the SuperDARN network. The list of active SuperDARN sites is maintained by the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.
