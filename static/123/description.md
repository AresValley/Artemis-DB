Coquelet is an MFSK system, similar to Piccolo. Uses ITA-2 charset. It's two main modes are Coquelet-8 and Coquelet-13. No longer in use.

Coquelet was developed by ACEC in Belgium for police and military use during the early 1960s. It had expanded to French security and customs use, as well as Algerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) and Customs use (Primarily used Coquelet-8 and Coquelet-80). Algeria was one of the last users of Coquelet, as moved on to newer modes they had been testing such as Racal MSM1250 "SkyFax" modems and modified PACTOR systems.

- Coquelet-8: 8-tone 300 Hz wide MFSK. Coquelet-8 has baud speeds of 13.33 Bd, 20 Bd, and 26.67 Bd.
- Coquelet-13: 13-tone 500 Hz wide MFSK. Coquelet-13 has baud speeds of 13.33 Bd and 20 Bd.
- Coquelet-80: Variant of Coquelet-8. Coquelet-80 adds FEC to the Coquelet-8 waveform. Includes sub-variants Coquelet-80S and - Coquelet-82S. The main difference is Coquelet-82S can be used in both side bands and uses extended handshaking and synchronizing sequences. Coquelet-80 borrows the same bandwidth and baud speeds of Coquelet-8.
