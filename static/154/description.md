DominoEX, also known as just Domino, is an IFK (Incremental Frequency Keying) mode developed by Murray Greenman ZL1BPU and Con Wassilieff ZL2AFP in 2004 that was the first fully developed iteration of the Domino IFK family modes Used to send text over RF. It is the successor to the developmental versions DominoF and DominoG.

IFK (Incremental Frequency Keying) is used, where the data is represented not by the frequency of each tone, but by the frequency difference between one tone and the next. An additional technique, called Offset Incremental Keying (IFK+) is used to manage the tone sequence in order to counter inter-symbol interference caused by multipath reception. This gives the mode a great improvement in robustness.

DominoEX had optional FEC for all of its available submodes.
