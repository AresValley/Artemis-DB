Thales Système 3000 is a HF modem capable of many different modes of transmission. It has a unique preamble and format to its signals. This modem is equipted on TRC-3600 and TRC-1752 transceivers developed by Thales in France. The modem supports ciphered voice as well as data transmission. Digital voice is also available as per STANAG 4479 standards with 800 bps w/ interleaving, or 2400 bps according to STANAG 4198, without interleaving.

This modem has two primary modes of operation. Standard and Skyhopper. The wide range of abilities to transmit gives it high robustness in transmitting and receiving communications in any propagation situation.

This modem can use a low-rate robust 8-MFSK mode at 375 bps uncoded, 100bps user data rate. For higher rates, 2-PSK, 4-PSK, or 8-PSK is used. With FEC, 5400 bps uncoded throughput. In ARQ mode, 4875 bps is possible. At the end of each transmission, an ALE is transmitted, 8-MFSK with 250 Hz spacing between tones.

The Système 3000 supports and is interoperable with STANAG 4481, STANAG 4285, STANAG 5000, DCS100 (KG-84C), KY99, and MIL-STD-188-141A (2G ALE).
