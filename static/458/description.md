TDF is a time signal transmitted on the former carrier of France's France Inter longwave AM radio station on 162 kHz. The carrier is phase modulated in 0.1 second every second, except for the 59th second of each minute. The data encoded in this signal is similar to DCF77, except for bit 13 and 14, which are set for holidays.

As of January 1st, 2017, France Inter's LW radio channel has ceased, but the TDF time signal carrier remains at 162 kHz.

# Characteristics
The TDF time signal is modulated in a way where it is inaudible and unnoticeable when listening to the radio station normally with AM. The recorded signal is in USB mode with the bandwidth and IF set so that only the carrier is in the passband, so you can hear the slight phase shifts in the carrier, as opposed to a constant CW carrier.
