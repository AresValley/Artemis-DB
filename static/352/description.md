OLIVIA is an amateur digital teletype mode designed by Pawel Jalocha SP9VRC in 2005. Its goal was to be effective even in poor propagation conditions. It can also decode well under other noise, QSB, QRM, flutter caused by polar path propagation and even auroral conditions. Olivia uses 7-bit ASCII alphabet. There are a handful of amateur digital modes that are derived from Olivia, including RTTYM and PAX.

Olivia is occasionally utilized during the Shortwave Radiogram transmissions, which run every weekend on WRMI and WINB (USA). See the SW Radiogram website for the schedule.

# Olivia Submodes
125, 250, 500, 1000, and 2000 are the available bandwidths. 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256 are the available tones. There are a total of 40 possible submodes.

Olivia's submodes are determined by bandwidth and number of tones. This is represented with the "OLIVIA X/Y" or "OLIVIA X-Y" format, where X = # of tones and Y = Bandwidth in Hz. E.g.: OLIVIA 8-250 means 8 tones with 250 Hz bandwidth.

The standard Olivia submodes (tone/bandwidth) are 4/125, 8/250, 16/500, 32/1000, and 64/2000.

The most commonly used submodes in order of use are 16/500, 8/500, 32/1000, 8/250, and 16/1000. Most Olivia usage is using one of the 7 following submodes: 32/1000, 16/1000, 16/500, 8/500, 8/250, 4/250, and 4/125.
