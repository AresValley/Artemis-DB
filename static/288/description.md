MD-522 (Also known as MIL-M-55529A) is a synchronous FSK mode built into GRC-MD522 teletypewriter sets and used for wirelessly transmitting ASCII information. MD-522 has a narrowband, wideband, and diversity mode. MD-552 uses the same general modulation type as MD-674.

The narrowband mode uses a shift of 85 Hz centered at 2805 Hz and with speeds of 50 Bd, 75 Bd, 100 Bd, and 110 Bd. The wideband mode had the same features as narrowband, but the shift is 850 Hz and is centered at 2000 Hz.

The Diversity mode uses two narrowband 85 Hz signals, one at 2805 Hz and at 425 Hz.
