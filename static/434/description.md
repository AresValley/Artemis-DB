STANAG 5065 is defined as "Minimum Standards for Naval Low Frequency (LF) Shore-To-Ship Surface Broadcast Systems", with two primary protocols, FSK75 and MSK300.

FSK75 uses a 85 Hz shift at 75 Bd. The upper frequency tone is the space, and the lower frequency tone is the mark.

MSK300 uses a 150 Hz shift at 300 Bd, MSK modulation.
