Ethernet Over Powerline, is an alternative way to reach ethernet cables through a set of adapters that go into outlets that can be plugged directly in the router instead of routing cables all the way from one end of a building to another. It creates the Pulse-Amplitude modulation that ethernet uses, over the RF waves, and can reach a bandwidth of 60 MHz depending on certain conditions. It can cause enormous interference in HF and lower VHF.
