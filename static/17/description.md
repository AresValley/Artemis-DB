Akkord-SS-PD (АККОРД-СС-ПД), also known as “Akkord-165” is a Russian datalink used during the invasion of Ukraine. Akkord is a fairly old family of datalink protocols, Akkord-165 being the most recent version.

It's speed varies between 1200, 2400, 4800 and 9600 bps, and the block lenght varies between (165, 144), (117, 96), (69, 48). Most of the intercepted radio links have been characterized by a telegraph speed of 1200 bps FSK with a shift of 800 Hz in the frequency range 5-7 MHz which suggests short to medium range distances.
