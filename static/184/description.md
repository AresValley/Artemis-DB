The Federal Signal Modem-MSK signalling protocol is developed for Federal Signal's line of civil defense warning siren systems. This signal is used for activation and telemetry of all units in a network.

The modem can be used in tandem with Federal Signal's Commander Digital System.

This protocol is commonly found among their line of Civil Defense Sirens, most commonly their FS DC-2001 siren. The system typically transmits daily at a user-defined time to poll health checks on units in the system. The system is also used during activation for testing, weather and other emergency events.
