Ground-Based Augmentation Systems (GBAS) forms part of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), and provides GPS corrections to aircraft on approach, guiding them to land. GBAS will eventually replace conventional Instrument Landing Systems, as it is more precise than ILS and is less expensive to install.

# Frequencies
GBAS is used on the VHF aeronautical radio navigation band between 108-117.975 MHz, with a 25 kHz channel spacing.
