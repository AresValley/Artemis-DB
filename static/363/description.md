PAX and PAX2 are developed by Patrick Lindecker F6CTE in 2005, and was derived from Olivia. It utilizes the AX.25 protocol that PACKET uses, and had a minimum SNR of -10dB. Can transmit APRS frames.

PAX has a baudrate of 62.5 Bd at 59 wpm and uses 8MFSK with 62.5 Hz shift between tones in a bandwidth of 500 Hz.

PAX2 is twice as fast as PAX and has a baudrate of 125 Bd at 117 wpm and uses 8MFSK with 125 Hz shift between tones in a bandwidth of 1000 Hz.

Both PAX modes use 6-bit ASCII encoding alphabet. PAX is more robust compared to PACKET.
