This type of signals is believed to originate from radio frequency heating and welding applications. RF heating is used in industry for drying wood products, welding plastics and for other purposes. Such heating equipment may radiate RF interference which can be picked up by radio receivers. During good propagation conditions, such interference may be hearable over long distances.

On a waterfall spectrum display, RF heating interference typically appears as wobbly peaks that drift downwards in frequency and last for some seconds. These are also called hooks, fish hooks and sweepers. The peaks may drift over several hundred kilohertz but sometimes stable peaks are seen as well.

Antenna tuning operation of amateur radio transceivers can produce signals that look similar on the waterfall and can be confused with this kind of interference. However, these tuning signals typically sweep through frequencies in a more controlled manner, often up and down, and do not produce a "wobbling" sound.

## Frequencies
RF heating equipment should operate on the designated Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) bands. However, due to poor frequency stability of such equipment, outright negligence or other reasons, they are commonly found outside the ISM bands as well.

The most common frequency range where this kind of interference can be found is approximately 24 MHz to 30 MHz which is close to the 27.12 MHz ISM band. It can also be found above 30 MHz in the low VHF band. Another quite common range is around the 13.56 MHz ISM band.
