A digital link to transmit images and other data collected from the satellite at a high resolution.

The NOAA POES series of satellites transmit high resolution pictures from the AVHRR (main radiometer) and additionally, data from AMSU (Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit), HIRS (High-resolution InfraRed Sounder), SEM (Space Environment Monitor) and, for NOAA 19 only, MHS (Microwave Humidity Sounder) instruments over an HRPT link.

The signal is PSK modulated at 665 kbit/s.

The main payload of HRPT is AVHRR data composed of six channels in the visible, near-infrared and infrared spectrum; only five of those can be transmitted together at a given time.

The data are digitized to 10-bit precision and transmitted at 360 lines per minute (LPM) at 665 kilobits per second (kbps). The HRPT data stream also includes non-imagery data from other instruments on board the spacecraft.
