BR-6028 is a VFT (Voice Frequency Telegraph) frequency and time diversity modem using 7 data channels. The BR Communications 6029C Modem and MD-1142/UGC Modem supported this signal.

Consists of multiple channels over one audio bandwidth with a pilot tone at ~560 Hz. Used by the US Military and Canadian Military, as well as many forces worldwide, in a special BR-6028 specification where each channel signal carries the same information but delayed by one second from the previous one (which can be seen in the ASCII mode image). This helps with error correction. In addition, certain channels which are severely affected by propagation conditions can be entirely turned off, so signals with less than 7 channels can be seen.

In addition, reports have confirmed that a variation of BR-6028 was used by some countries that had Channel 2 entirely turned off, while leaving the rest on.

There are several modulation modes used by BR-6028. The most common one seen is RTTY. BR-6028 has also been seen with ASCII, ARQ-E, and Link-14.

The RTTY mode uses between 45 and 100 Bd, with 170 Hz shift in each channel. The ASCII mode uses between 30 and 110 Bd, with 150 Hz shift in each channel. The ARQ-E was reported to run at 46.15 Bd with a 4-character repetition cycle, and the Link-14 one at 75 Bd.

No logs of BR-6028 have been seen since 2012.
