TETRA is a professional mobile radio and two-way transceiver (walkie-talkie) specification. Formerly known as Trans-European Trunked Radio. Used extensively in Europe, especially Great Britain and Germany. Modulated with Ï€/4 DQPSK. Runs on 18000 baud with 36000 bps maximum user bitrate. TETRA is not to be confused with Tetrapol.

Several levels of encryption are offered, however, many networks are unencrypted. For unencrypted networks, several software projects (see links below) exist allowing decoding of low-level signaling and full voice decode. There is also a basic Wireshark GSMTAP dissector and on some networks SDSs (short data messages) can be decoded.

Encryption specification is available only with NDA from ETSI link.
