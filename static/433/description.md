STANAG 4539 or MIL-STD-188-110B/C Appendix C is a HDR (110B) / MDR (110C) serial PSK/QAM signal that can reach speeds up to 9600 bps (12800 bps with no interleaving). In 110B, this was designated as High Data Rate, but in 110C, this mode was recategorized Medium Data Rate. It is officially designated as "HF data waveforms for data rates above 2400 bps in 3 kHz channels."

Has similar operation and parameters as the mandatory MIL-STD-188-110 Serial mode, but uses different modulations and higher speeds. In addition, each speed except for 12800 bps has 6 different interleaving modes. Ultra Short, Very Short, Short, Medium, Long, and Very Long.

| Data Rate (bps) | Bits per Symbol (Modulation) | FEC Encoding Rate |
|-----------------|------------------------------|-------------------|
| 12800 bps       | 6 (64QAM)                    | None              |
| 9600 bps        | 6 (64QAM)                    | 3/4               |
| 8000 bps        | 5 (32QAM)                    | 3/4               |
| 6400 bps        | 4 (16QAM)                    | 3/4               |
| 4800 bps        | 3 (8PSK)                     | 3/4               |
| 3200 bps        | 2 (QPSK)                     | 3/4               |
