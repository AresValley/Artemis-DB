CIS FTM-4 is the unofficial designation of a 4-MFSK data mode which is apparently used by Russian military. It's also known with other names such as CIS 4FSK 150bd but the official name and equipment used to transmit it are unknown.

The signal consists of four tones spaced 4 kHz apart, making the total bandwidth slightly over 12 kHz. Symbol rate is 150bd. Something can be seen between the four tones as well.
