CIS-12 (Also known as MS5, FIRE, AT-3004D, or AT-3104D) is a 12-tone PSK Russian military multi-channel modem. It features scrambled voice/ data-communication at a maximum data rate of 4800 bps. Each subcarrier transmits at 120 Bd. There is 200 Hz of spacing between each subcarrier.

This waveform is transmitted by the AT-3004D and the newer AT-3104D military modems in use by the Russian Military. These modems were designed to have many different devices plugged into them to form the modem’s input – most often teleprinters unique to the different military services and civilian agencies that use them, and also, vocoders and speech encipherment systems, but all are transmitted in the same fashion.

A characteristic trait of this signal is the unmodulated pilot tone at 3300 Hz.
