The High Frequency Global Communications System, HFGCS for short, is a series of networks created by the United States Air Force to send coded messages to deployed aircraft. There are seven frequencies used by the system, but some messages are usually transmitted on one frequency. When a message is transmitted on one or more (Sometimes even all) of these frequencies, an echo can be heard in the transmission. Those that broadcast these messages are given code names, some examples are 'Backyard', 'Racetrack', or 'Apathy'. The messages are decoded in a NATO phonetic-numeral alphabet. There is no channel marker for these frequencies. The messages are sent through EAMs, or Emergency Action Messages.

# Skykings
Skykings come from the United States Strategic Command, and interrupt all other traffic, including EAMs. Skykings consists of an operator saying "Skyking Skyking Do Not Answer", time into the minute (If it were 0932 Z, '32' would be said), and an authentication string that consists of two NATO phonetics, such as 'Charlie Juliet'. They are repeated once, and often with poor reception.
