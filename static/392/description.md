RDL is a Russian VLF station located in Krasnodar. It is one of the few VLF stations that changes modes during routine transmissions.

The station has two modes of operation:

Fast FSK, used most of the time
Slow Morse FSK, cleartext. Usually broadcasts the callsign, followed by some numbers, and finishing with the time of the transmission.
The transmissions will cease, or switch to a very low power when the message is sent. The duration of the transmission is very variable, from less than a minute to more than ten.
