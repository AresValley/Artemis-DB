SAQ is the only remaining transmitter based on an alternating current generator. Recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site, it employs the last operational Alexanderson alternator for RF production.

SAQ shares its antenna with the Swedish navy which operates SAS/SRC at 40.4 kHz at the same site (Varberg).

So SAS/SRC ist always turned off when SAQ is on air.
