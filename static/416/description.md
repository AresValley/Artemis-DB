Swedish navy transmitter for submarine communication. It shares the antenna with SAQ (Grimeton Radio) and is activated less often as the other Swedish transmitters used for VLF submarine communication. Usually, it works with reduced power.

Swedish MSK transmitters can easily be identified in the waterfall diagram by their fishbone-like modulation pattern. This seems to belong to the idle phases where no data are transmitted.

The fishbone pattern is even audible as a characteristic modulation.
