ATIS systems are identification tags used by inland commercial waterway traffic on rivers in Europe. The FSK burst is appended at the end of every voice transmission by the vessel operator. It lasts for 285 milliseconds after the PTT button has been released.

ATIS is in use among European countries that are part of the Regional Arrangement Concerning the Radiotelephone Service on Inland Waterways or RAINWAT. The system is in particular use along the River Rhine, as well as the Danube and Rhone rivers.

The ATIS transmission contains a unique identifying number based on a ship's MMSI number. The primary difference between MMSI and ATIS numbers are that ATIS numbers add a 9 at the front, so that ATIS identification numbers are 10 digits long. e.g. MMSI: 207072225 ; ATIS: 9207072225.

The ATIS transmission burst has a baud rate of 1200 Bd, and an 800 Hz shift. In addition, FEC is used in the transmission.
