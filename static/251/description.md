An Ionosonde (Also known as a chirpsounder or ionospheric sounder) is a radar that examines the Ionosphere and monitors HF propagation conditions by sweeping the HF band and receiving the echoes.

Ionosondes sweep from 1-40Mhz. They send a line of very short pulses up the band. It looks like a slanted line when observed on a waterfall display.

Ionosondes are examples of Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) based radar.

Ionosondes can operate at a range from 1 MHz to 40 MHz, however they primarily operate between 1.6 MHz to 12 MHz.
