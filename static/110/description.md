Very little information about this over-the-horizon radar is available. The name "Foghorn" was apparently coined by amateur radio operators or shortwave listeners based on the sound that resembles a ship foghorn.

Type 2319 has been mentioned in the UDXF community logs, but it has not been confirmed if this is the correct name for this radar.

The radar transmits FMCW signal with about 10 kHz of bandwidth in bursts that typically last a few seconds, but may take longer as well. Sweep rates of 42, 48, 50, 67 and 83 Hz have been observed. 67 Hz is probably the most common, and 83 Hz is rare. Unlike some other OTH radars, this radar does not seem to transmit an intro tone before the burst. Transmission often happens on multiple nearby frequencies in a sequential manner.

Some sources claim that this radar uses pulsed modulation. This seems to be a misunderstanding unless there is another radar that uses similar transmission parameters and transmits in pulses.

Frequency range of this radar is not well known. It can change its frequency according to propagation conditions. Ranges from 6 MHz to 29 MHz and 7 MHz to 25 MHz have been reported.
