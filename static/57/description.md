BPC is the callsign of a time signal broadcasting from the BPC Shangqiu Low-Frequency Time-Code Radio Station, cooperatively constructed by the National Time Service Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (中国科学院国家授时中心) and Xi’an Gaohua Technology Company. It was constructed on April 25, 2002.

BPC transmits a time signal on 68.5 kHz, which can be used for synchronizing radio controlled clocks. As opposed to other time signal transmitters, the signal format is not published openly; a special license is required. The transmission site is situated near Shangqiu, Henan Province (商丘市,河南省) at 34.457°N 115.837°E.

BPC broadcasts at 90 kW for 21 hours per day, with a 3-hour break from 05:00–08:00 (China Standard Time) daily (21:00–24:00 UTC). BPC includes both conventional amplitude modulated time code and additional spread-spectrum time code, about which little is known
