This is what the signal of a military S-Band (In this case 2.4 GHz) RADAR and WiFi intentional interference (Jamming) device looks like. This signal is generated by a DDS system and is then used to modulate the output of a 2.45 GHz magnetron (The same as in a microwave oven).

As stated above this signal is used to jam S-Band RADAR and is also used to jam S-Band communications technology, such as WiFi, Bluetooth, LoRa, etc.. The signal shown in the attached image is of the device running in WiFi jamming mode, the wide-band signal you see is only one of many harmonic signals generated using resonating cavities and specially designed waveguide geometries, the source of the RF energy for the waveguide-cavity system is an off-the-shelf 2.45 GHz magnetron, sold for large industrial ovens, and rated at 20 kW with forced-air cooling, 35 kW with water-cooling. A computer system contains many stored wave-forms and employs Direct Digital Synthesis (DDS) technology, the signals are then applied to a modulator tube then the magnetron to effect intentional interference to targeted systems, In this case the system is jamming WiFi signals outside of a military base in Canada, however it is capable of generating many other signals including micro-second pulses designed to interfere with RADAR systems, it can also generate powerful CW output in excess of 15kW and can be directed using an electromagnetic lens to physically destroy enemy electronic systems by inducing fatally high voltages and currents on the systems cabling and other metal parts. (Think putting a cellphone in a microwave oven) Because of its versatility, devices such as this can disrupt or otherwise interfere with any radio system in their range of frequencies, and can even physically destroy some systems.
