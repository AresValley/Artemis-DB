HFDL, also known as HF-ACARS, ARINC 753, ARINC 635, and HF DATALINK,is a data link that aircraft use to communicate short messages over long distances using HF signals. HFDL is defined in ARINC spec 753.

Transmissions on HF are in USB on a sub-carrier of 1440 Hz with a symbol speed of 1800 baud. Data is sent at 300, 600, 1200 or 1800 bps. HFDL can use BPSK, QPSK, and 8-PSK.

Waterfall appearance of HFDL can be confused with the JORN radar, but HFDL can be differentiated by its narrower bandwidth and entirely different sound.
