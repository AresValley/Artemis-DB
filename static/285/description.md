The Low Rate Picture Transmission (LRPT) is a digital transmission system, intended to deliver images and data from an orbital weather satellite directly to end users via a VHF radio signal. It is used aboard polar-orbiting, near-Earth weather satellite programs such as MetOp (LRPT permanently deactivated on MetOp-A due to interference with on HIRS) and NPOESS (replaced with JPSS), and is currently being used on METEOR-M satellites.

# Characteristics
LRPT transmits at ~120 kHz Bandwidth. The signal transmits using QPSK at 72 kBd (72,000 symbols per second) with a raw data rate of 144 kbps. The datastream is processed using a Reedâ€“Solomon error correction, then convolution encoded, interleaved, and padded with unique synchronization words.

The bandwidth is sufficient for 3 channels from the MSU-MR radiometer. Any of the six channels provided by the radiometer can be selected to be transmitted in the LRPT data stream.
