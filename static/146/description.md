Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM) is a digital commercial broadcasting mode used to deliver FM-comparable sound quality to shortwave radio. DRM is a digital alternative to AM shortwave radio. WinDRM is an amateur adoption of this mode.

DRM uses COFDM (Coded Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) with QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation).

DRM is commonly seen with 10 kHz of bandwidth. Other bandwidths are used rarely.

# Bandwidths
DRM is commonly seen with 10 kHz of bandwidth. Other bandwidths are used rarely.

- 4.5 kHz. Gives the ability for the broadcaster to do a simulcast and use the lower-sideband area of a 9 kHz raster channel for AM, with a 4.5 kHz DRM signal occupying the area traditionally taken by the upper-sideband.[12] However the resulting bit rate and audio quality is not good.
- 5 kHz. Gives the ability for the broadcaster to do a simulcast and use the lower-sideband area of a 10 kHz raster channel for AM, with a 5 kHz DRM signal occupying the area traditionally taken by the upper-sideband. However the resulting bitrate and audio quality is marginal (7.1–16.7 kbit/s for 5 kHz). This technique could be used on the short wave bands throughout the world.
- 9 kHz. Occupies half the standard bandwidth of a region–1 long wave or medium wave broadcast channel.
- 10 kHz. Occupies half the standard bandwidth of a region–2 broadcast channel. could be used to simulcast with analogue audio channel restricted to NRSC5. Occupies a full worldwide shortwave broadcast channel (giving 14.8–34.8 kbit/s)
- 18 kHz. Occupies full bandwidth of region–1 long wave or medium wave channels according to the existing frequency plan. This offers better audio quality.
- 20 kHz. Occupies full bandwidth of region–2 or 3 AM channel according to the existing frequency plan. This offers highest audio quality of the DRM30 standard (giving 30.6–72 kbit/s).

# Modes
DRM has 4 main modes, from A to D. Different modes are used to accommodate varying propagation conditions.

- A: Gaussian channel with very little multipath propagation and Doppler effect. This profile is suited for local or regional broadcasting.
- B: multipath propagation channel. This mode is suited for medium range transmission. It is nowadays frequently used.
- C: similar to mode B, but with better robustness to Doppler (more carrier spacing). This mode is suited for long distance transmission.
- D: similar to mode B, but with a resistance to large delay spread and Doppler spread. This case exists with adverse propagation conditions on very long distance transmissions. The useful bit rate for this profile is decreased.
