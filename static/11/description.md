5G cellular, also known by 3GPP '5G' NR (new radio), etc. is a newly released cellular standard that allows for backwards compatibility with 4G LTE, and will allow for several gigabits of connection speeds, (up to 10-100Gb) per second. This is the 600 MHz downlink band for the new standard. 5G is currently in commercial use across more than 90 countries. In the U.S, AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile are the major 5G carriers. T-Mobile launched commercial 5G service in 2019 with 600 MHz (n71) and mmWave (n261, n260 and n258) bands. Merger with Sprint brought additional bands (n25, 1.9 GHz and n41, 2.5 GHz) for capacity. 5G can be either SA (Standalone) or non-Standalone (NSA) depending on the hardware and software implementations. The actual sound of 5G is derived from 4G, its more of a "pulse sound", because of the UFMC modulation component.
