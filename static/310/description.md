The Marconi Selenia 25-Tone Modem is a military modem developed sometime around 2003 by Marconi Selenia Communications (Now Finmeccanica). It supports ECCM capability and transmits at a datarate of 2400bps.

# Characteristics
The 25-Tone Modem employs OFDM across a bandwidth of ~1600 Hz. There are 25 total QPSK subcarriers. On the lower half there are 12 subcarriers, and on the upper half there are 13. Each subcarrier is spaced ~60 Hz from each other, and each subcarrier transmits at ~48 Bd for a total bit rate of 2400 bps.

# Standard
The standard Non-ECM mode has a ~510 ms preamble made of two main parts. The first part is a quick 3 + pilot tone preamble lasting ~260 ms. The One of the three tones is a continuous tone and the other two are FSK with a shift of ~485 Hz at ~50 Bd. The second part is a preamble in the data transmission lasting ~250 ms.

# ECCM
The ECCM mode is designed to mitigate ECM efforts such as jamming. This mode uses a ~450 ms long 3-tone preamble made up of one unmodulated tone and two FSK tones of ~485 Hz shift at ~50 Bd. There is no pilot tone and no further preamble, and these transmissions are shorter in duration than Non-ECM.
