CCIR Selcall consists of CCIR-1, CCIR-2, and PCCIR, which are 5-tone selcall modes for VHF/UHF radios. CCIR-1 and CCIR-2 only differ in the tone duration, and PCCIR only differs in the group, reset, and repeat tone frequencies. CCIR-2 is also known as CCIR-7, because CCIR-2 is based on CCIR-7 recommendations; CCIR-1 is based on CCIR-1 recommendations. CCIR stands for Comit√© Consultatif International des Radiocommunications, which has now become the ITU-R.

Selcall (selective calling) is a type of squelch protocol used in radio communications systems, in which transmissions include a brief burst of sequential audio tones. Receivers that are set to respond to the transmitted tone sequence will open their squelch, while others will remain muted.

# CCIR-1 and CCIR-2
CCIR-1 has a 100 ms tone duration per tone, where CCIR-2 has a 70 ms tone duration. Both have 16 tones to choose from, but only send bursts of up to 5 tones. The bursts transmit right before a radio transmission. Each tone corresponds with either a number or letter, as denoted by the table below. This signal was primarily used in Europe, specifically the Swedish and Turkish police forces.

# PCCIR
PCCIR shares the same tone frequencies as CCIR-1 and CCIR-2, but changes the frequency of tone for the Group (A), Reset (C), and Repeat(E) tones. PCCIR also lacks an F tone, so it only has 15 tones. Each tone has a 100 ms duration.
