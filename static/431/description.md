STANAG 4481, also known as CRATT, Link-4, and NATO-75, is specified by the NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) Military Agency for Standardization as a "Minimum technical equipment standards for naval HF shore-to-ship broadcast system"

# Modes
- 4481 FSK: Synchronous FSK mode, which uses KG-84 encryption for communication. It is commonly found in the HF band. A number of communication parameter settings are possible, but 75 Bd and a shift of 850 Hz are widely used. Bd rates include 75, 100, 150, 300, and 600 Bd.
- 4481 PSK: This utilizes binary phase shift keying (BPSK) of a single tone 1800 Hz sub-carrier with a constant modulation speed of 2400 Bd. Through the use of BPSK modulation and a FEC coding rate of 1/4, the effective user data rate is 300 bps. Take note that this mode looks and sounds almost identical to STANAG 4285, since both have a 3000 Hz Bandwidth with 2400 Bd symbol rate.
