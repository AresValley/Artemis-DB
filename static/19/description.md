AMSAT-P3D (Known as Phase 3D, OSCAR-40, and AO-40) is a amateur radio satellite built by AMSAT. As of 2004, the satellite's systems have failed.

The satellite was OSCAR-40, and was built and launched by the German chapter AMSAT-DL of AMSAT. It was launched on November 16, 2000, and boasted 5 receivers (in the HF, VHF/UHF, L, S, and C bands) and seven transmitters (in the HF, K, VHF/UHF, S, and X-bands), as well as a number of experimental instruments and equipment for scientific measurement.

The satellite suffered technical faults on December 13th, 2000, due to a protective cap having accidentally remained before launch. This caused an explosion that affected the satellite.

On January 25, 2004, due to effects caused by the explosion, the satellite suffered a critical failure when the main battery failed, short circuiting the auxiliary battery. Since then, only one official suspected contact was heard from the satellite.
