iBiquity HD Radio is a proprietary digital broadcast radio format transmitted in North America, usually as sidebands on analog carriers. This is the AM band implementation of HD Radio. This system exists on both FM and AM Bands. This system was developed by iBiquity, which has been acquired by DTS in 2016.

HD Radio is an OFDM digital broadcast that usually coincides with an analog signal, but in the AM band you may find signals that are purely HD Radio format, in a similar fashion as DRM. HD radio can also have multiple soundtracks, adding to the number of radio stations you can listen to on a given frequency channel.

Currently, hybrid implementations employ IBOC techniques by adding extended subcarriers to existing analog transmissions so that both analog and digital formats can be supported. In the future it is hoped that this will allow a gradual segway into fully-digital radio broadcasts.

For AM IBOC, each HD Radio sideband is 5kHz wide.
