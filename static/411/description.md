One-way error-correcting broadcast system, used by one of Russian intelligence agencies for delivery of messages to their operatives abroad on fixed schedules.

This system conveys encrypted, nameless binary files, with clear binary headers, stating the ID of the recipient, the date the message was written, its serial number, and its length. Its broadcasts often don't contain messages, and may also carry two messages in one broadcast.

This mode sends on fixed schedules, consisting of three broadcasts spaced 10 minutes apart. Each subsequent broadcast sends on a frequency lower between 500 kHz and 3 MHz, but typically it's 2 MHz lower. Each transmission lasts 6-8 minutes, repeating the data continuously, and each repeat is followed by 256 zero bits.
