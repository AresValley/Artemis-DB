The Buzzer, call-sign НЖТИ (NZhTI), nicknamed Жужжалка, formerly known by its previous callsigns АНВФ (ANVF), ЖУОЗ (ZhUOZ), МДЖБ (MDZhB) and УЗБ-76 (UZB-76), is a Russian-based military station that frequently broadcasts Monolit format messages in Russian. Its official name is actually вулкан (Vulkan, Volcano in English). Its trademark buzzer is constantly transmitted while there is no message to broadcast. Active since the late 1970s.

NZhTI is an analogue Upper Side Band voice signal. It has an active carrier at 4625 kHz. It is believed that the buzzer is not directly modulated but actually recorded by a active microphone, as there have been reports of hearing background chatter while the buzzer was on.

On September 7, 2010, The Buzzer changed its callsign from УЗБ-76 (UZB-76) to МДЖБ (MDZhB)

Since October 15, 2015, The Buzzer has been seen transmitting in parallel on a new frequency 6998 kHz, while still transmitting on 4625 kHz.

On December 28, 2015, The Buzzer has changed its call-sign to ЖУОЗ (ZhUOZ).

On March 1, 2019, The Buzzer has changed its call-sign to АНВФ (ANVF).

On December 30, 2020, The Buzzer has changed its call-sign to НЖТИ (NZhTI).

On January 19, 2022, the two sites became active in sending out the monolit ciphers to the navy for a planned upcoming invasion of the Ukraine.
