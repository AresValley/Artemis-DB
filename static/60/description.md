BIIS (also known as BIIS 1200) is an ETSI protocol for a digital selective calling method with the added benefit of extended capability of transmitting data that exceeds what could be done with old 5-tone analog calling methods like CCIR and ZVEI.

BIIS is defined as ETSI 300-230 and it's official description is "A Selective Calling and Data Transmission on Single Frequencies System". BIIS operates at 1200 bps, which gives its name BIIS 1200. This is used by many public and private users, such as the Italian Red Cross. Receivers like Icom IC-F1710 also support this digital calling mode.

BIIS has a center frequency of 1500 Hz with a FSK shift of 600 Hz. Channel spacing is set at 12.5, 20, and 25 kHz.

BIIS 1200 operates on the PMR446 band (Personal Mobile Radio 446 MHz).
