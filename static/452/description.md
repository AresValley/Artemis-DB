The RTS-9TS (РТС-9Ц) Russian spacecraft telemetry system is an old and widely used in the USSR/Russia telemetry system for spacecraft. Currently used on the Russian segment of the ISS, Soyuz/Progress spacecraft, and Meteor meteorological satellites. Telemetry transmission is usually switched on only within the visibility range of Russian tracking stations; in the case of the ISS, streams may not be active from every module at the same time.
