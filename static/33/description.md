Accurate positioning by Low Frequencies, a former German DGPS navigation system. No longer in use as of 2013

The system serviced all of Germany, with a 600 km - 800 km range from the transmitting antenna near Frankfurt.

This signal operated at 1187.6 Baud and used BPSK modulation. This signal also used the RDS format used in commercial FM sidebands for the low bitrate dissemination of information. This version of RDS was transmitted in SSB with a decreased pilot level to reduce the bandwidth.
