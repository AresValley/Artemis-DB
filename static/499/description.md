WEFAX (Also known as Weatherfax, HF-FAX, Radiofax, and Weather Facsimile) is a slow scan analog image transmission mode used for the transmission of weather charts and meteorological reports. The only station known to be sending newspaper articles (in Japanese) is the Fukushima Fisheries service in Japan.

WEFAX was originally developed for satellite usage, but has gained usage in the HF bands in the past decades. Satellite WEFAX use can be seen at Meteosat WEFAX.

# Format
WEFAX's format is a derivative of the Automatic Picture Transmission (APT) originally developed for transmission from the polar satellites of the USA.

WEFAX has 60, 90, 100, 120, 180 and 240 LPM (Lines per minute) speeds, and two IOC (Index of Cooperation) modes, IOC 576 and IOC 288. Most weather forecasts are sent in IOC 576.
