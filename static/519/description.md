The North Korean jamming signal is frequently detected interfering with South Korean broadcast stations, particularly on shortwave bands, where it is most commonly observed around the 6.6 MHz frequency. This signal is recognized as a white noise jammer, designed specifically to disrupt communication by generating a broad spectrum of noise that obscures or drowns out the intended broadcast.

What sets this jammer apart is its carrier signal, which exhibits a notable frequency-hopping behavior. Rather than remaining fixed, the carrier tends to shift slightly above and below the central frequency of 6.6 MHz, creating an erratic and unpredictable pattern that makes it more difficult to isolate and counteract.

The persistence of this signal and its strategic placement over South Korean broadcasts strongly suggests it is a deliberate act of electronic warfare, likely orchestrated by North Korean authorities.
