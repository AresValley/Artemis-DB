One Beep, Two Beeps is a nickname given to a signal emitted by the Norwegian Navy communications center in Bod√∏ (callsigns: LBA, LBJ, JWG, JWT, JWZ, JXU). As implied by the name, it consists of noise with occasional 760 Hz beeps, one or more at a time.

The signal sometimes appears on the Norwegian STANAG 4285 channels.
