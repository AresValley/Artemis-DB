PACTOR IV is the newest iteration of the PACTOR series, advancing from PACTOR I-III. It is 1.5x-3x faster than PACTOR III, and has 10 speed levels.

This is a proprietary standard developed by SCS GmbH & Co. KG, Hanau, Germany. This mode is used exclusively in SCS's P4dragon series of shortwave data modems. The P4dragon series modems are all backwards compatible with PACTOR I-III, and, like PACTOR II and III, uses PACTOR I SELCALL to establish connections with other modems.

PACTOR is used by many groups, including Sailmail for mariners to send and receive emails. It is also used by Ham Radio operators, Governmental and Diplomatic agencies, and even NGO's.

# Free-to-Use Competitors
Since PACTOR hardware modems are relatively expensive, the WINMOR and ARDOP software modes were developed after PACTOR to give amateur radio operators a means to send email over radio for free. VARA, which is a shareware mode, may have been developed as a lower-cost competitor to PACTOR III with similar transmission speeds, though PACTOR's reliability is said to be better than VARA.

# Winlink
Winlink (formerly RMS Express) is an amateur radio global radio messaging service which can relay messages sent by radio to conventional e-mail servers. Winlink's radio messaging software client is called Winlink Express. Winlink Express is compatible with several PACTOR hardware modems, as well as WINMOR, ARDOP, and VARA. Winlink Express is available for Windows users only (or other x86 operating systems if run with Wine). Linux, Mac, and Raspberry Pi users may use Pat, which is compatible with PACTOR, WINMOR, and ARDOP.
