Amplitude Modulation Signalling System (AMSS) is a DRM-based radiotext and data technology for AM broadcasting, like RDS that is used for FM Radio. It transmits as a subcarrier, phase-modulating the carrier frequency. This system was standardized by ETSI under ETSI TS 102 386 (based on ITU BS.706)

AMSS is designed to ease the transition from analogue to digital radio. It allows limited additional service information features to be provided to analogue listeners (for example, assisted re-tuning) in order to give them a taste of the full enhancements provided by digital broadcasting (for example, greatly improved audio quality). Further, it assists DRM receivers equipped with AM decoders with AMSS to find DRM transmissions of the same service in the same area or when the receiver is moved to a new area.

AMSS transmits as a subcarrier, phase-modulating the carrier frequency. AMSS is modulated onto the AM carrier in a way that the signal is barely audible on a standard receiver.

It uses the same data format as used in DRM for station identification.

AMSS is designed to be used on longwave, shortwave and medium wave bands AM broadcast channels
