Beta is the designation of a Russian VLF time signal service, controlled by All-Russian Scientific Research Institute for Physical-Engineering and Radiotechnical Metrology, and operated by Russian Navy. It is transmitted several times per day from 6 transmitter stations which take turns transmitting the signal and only one station transmits at a time.

The six Beta transmitters are:

- RJH63, Krasnodar, Russia
- RJH69, Vilyeyka, near Molodechno, Belarus
- RJH77, Archangelsk, Russia
- RJH86, Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan
- RJH90, Nizhny Novgorod, Russia
- RAB99, Khabarovsk, Russia

Transmitter output power has been estimated to be 1000 kW but due to the low efficiency of electrically short antennas, transmitted power may be around 30 to 50 kW EIRP.

Beta transmissions start on the hour and 8 transmissions should happen every day. RJH63 and RAB99 use slightly different schedule compared to the other stations.

## Time code format
The actual time code is transmitted using the following format:

- Each 100 ms, a 25 ms burst of carrier is transmitted
- Each second, a 100 ms burst of carrier is transmitted
- Each 10 s, a 1 s burst of carrier is transmitted
- Each minute, a 10 s burst of carrier is transmitted
