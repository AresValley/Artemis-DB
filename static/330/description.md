The Direct Sounder Broadcast (DSB) is an auxiliary telemetry downlink from NOAA Polar Operational Environmental Satellites (POES), transmitted alongside Automatic Picture Transmission (APT) broadcasts. DSB in this context is not to be confused with Dual Side Band modulation.

# Characteristics
The DSB telemetry sends scientific and debugging data from the onboard TIROS Information Processor onboard NOAA weather satellites. The telemetry data contains information and measurements from the following onboard devices:

- The HIRS/3 and HIRS/4 instruments which is a high resolution infrared sounder which can be used to create a low resolution multi-spectral scan of the earth. (more info)
- The Space Environment Monitor (SEM-2) which has a Medium Energy Proton and Electron Detector (MEPED), and a Total Energy Detector (TED). This experiment is used to measure the effect of the sun on satellite communications. (more info)
- The experimental DCS/2 transmitter which retransmits signals from 401.65 MHz sea buoys, arctic fox collars, sea ice monitors, weather balloons and more. (more info pdf)
- The ARGOS Advanced Data Collection System (ADCS) which amongst other uses is used in research for tracking animal GPS collars around the world.

The telemetry signal itself is a Dual side band-modulated PSK signal spanning about 33.5 kHz.

- The DSB uses PSK with -67/+67 degree modulation index.
- Transmitter Power (EOL) 1.0 watts (30dBm)
- Radiated Power (dBm) .5 (over 90% of sphere)
- Signal is Right-Circular Polarized (RCP)
