NXDN is a digital narrowband trunked radio protocol developed by ICOM Inc. and JVCKENWOOD Co. The NXDN protocol is used in commercial, business & industry, transport and Public Safety professional radio systems. NXDN has recently been recognized by the ITU as an international digital radio communications standard.

NXDN uses FDMA, and a NXDN channel be either 12.5 kHz or 6.25 kHz wide. 6.25 kHz dual-channel systems can be configured to fit within a 12.5 kHz channel. This effectively doubles the spectrum efficiency compared to an analog FM system occupying a 12.5 kHz channel. The architecture of NXDN is such that two NXDN channels, within a 12.5 kHz channel for example, can be allocated as voice/voice, voice/data, or data/data.

Kenwood's brand for NXDN equipment is "NEXEDGE", while Icom's brand for NXDN equipment is "IDAS", or Icom Digital Advanced System.
