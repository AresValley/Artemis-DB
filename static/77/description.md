Enigma designation XPB is a custom 16-tone MFSK mode which is believed to be used by Russian intelligence.

The signal occupies about 2.8 kHz of bandwidth, but the first tone is about 500 Hz away from the designated transmission frequency, making the total bandwidth about 3.3 kHz.

A 13-tone variant and slower transfer rate modes exist but it's not known if they use the same signal format or are used for the same purpose.

XPB transmissions occur on numerous frequencies between 10 MHz and 20.1 MHz. Frequencies between 4.4 MHz and 10 MHz have also been used, but it's not known if they are used since 2022.
