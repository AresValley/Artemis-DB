The Q-MAC HF Modem is a military modem developed by Q-MAC (acquired by Barrett Communications). It uses OFDM with a BPSK sync channel in a gap of the signal. This mode is used in Q-MAC modems and transceivers and supports the transmission of encrypted data and digital voice.

# Characteristics
This Q-MAC mode uses DQPSK (pi/4 QPSK) in the data subcarriers. On the lower frequency side there are 20 of these subcarriers running at ~43.1 Bd each. Each subcarrier is spaced ~54.1 Hz from each other.

About ~200 Hz above the 20 subcarriers is a synchronizing BPSK channel repeating the same pattern over and over again. This BPSK channel also runs at 43.1 Bd. About ~190 Hz above the synch BPSK are 10 DQPSK subcarriers all with the same parameters as the previous group of subcarriers, giving the total number of data subcarriers to be 30, plus the one sync BPSK channel, 31.

The raw data rate is ~2586 bps with all the 30 data channels.
