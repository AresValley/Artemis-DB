Fast low-latency access with seamless handoff orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (FLASH-OFDM) uses MC-CDMA, a modulation combining the characteristics of OFDM and CDMA, introduced around 2005. Specifically, the type of MC-CDMA technology used is referred to as FH-OFDMA. The FLASH-OFDM network is a IP based mobile communications system developed by Flarion. This network was implemented in the 450 MHz band in a some regions in Europe including Finland, Slovakia and Germany as a replacement for NMT-450 and C-Net C450 signals before ultimately being switched off around 2015. Some FLASH-OFDM services existed in the United States for a short period of time (2009).

Flarion advertised FLASH-OFDM has speeds of 1Mbps downlink in a 1.25 FDD spectrum with peak 3.2 Mbps downlink burst and having 300-500kbps uplink with 900kbps peak uplink burst.


MC-CDMA technology is an umbrella term describing systems with both multi-carrier, such as OFDM, and CDMA characteristics. FLASH-OFDM uses fast frequency hopping within an OFDM channel (FH-OFDMA), where each user is assigned a different tone every symbol.

Although Flarion designed products and devices to use 450 MHz, 700 MHz, 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 1900 MHz, and 2100 MHz, only public implementation of the 450 MHz network was ever documented.
