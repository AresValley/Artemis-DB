iDEN is a TDMA-based digital wireless standard designed to work in special frequencies originally designated for analog Specialized Mobile Radio (SMR) networks. It is a type of trunked radio with cellular phone benefits. iDEN was invented by Motorola, who remains the primary manufacturer of iDEN devices. iDEN is considered to be a ESMR (Enhanced Specialized Mobile Radio) network. iDEN uses TDMA with QAM Modulation for data.

The iDEN system uses M16-QAM modulation, a Motorola proprietary digital format utilizing M16-QAM modulation on four subcarriers. This format involves both amplitude and phase modulation.

Each main signal is divided into 4 sub-channels. Each sub-channel is about 4.5 kHz wide. The entire channel's operating bandwidth is 25kHz, although the signal itself takes only 18.5 kHz.

From a U.S. regulatory perspective iDEN networks are not considered cellular phone systems and are licensed to operate on 800MHz SMR frequency allocations (851 - 869 MHz band for towers; 806 - 824 MHz for mobiles). Thus they do not enjoy any of the special protections afforded cellular phone systems transmissions. So while a private citizen is not permitted to monitor cellular phone traffic it remains perfectly legal to monitor exactly the same type of traffic on an iDEN network.

Outside the U.S. iDEN may be known as DIMRS (Digital Integrated Mobile Radio Service).

iDEN cannot be decoded due to proprietary nature.

iDEN was previously operated by Nextel in the U.S. After the merger with Sprint Corporation in 2005, it has been decommissioned and most of the spectrum is currently in use for 4G LTE (Band 26)

The transmission format is designed for 25 kHz channel spacing. Data is transmitted using four 16QAM modulated sub-channels; with each sub-channel carrying 4000 symbols / second we end up with a total raw bit rate of 64 kbits/sec. The channel throughput then comes out to very roughly 3 bits/sec/Hz.
