POCSAG (Post Office Code Standardisation Advisory Group), also known as Super-POCSAG, Radio Paging Code No. 1 or RPC1, is a one-way 2FSK paging protocol that supports 512, 1200, and 2400 bps. POCSAG transmissions of different speeds and different paging protocols (e.g. FLEX) on the same paging channel are supported. POCSAG's official designation is "CCIR Recommendation 584, Radio Paging Code No. 1".

The Post Office Code Standardisation Advisory Group was from the British Post Office, which used to run nearly all telecommunications in Britain before privatization.

# Characteristics
POCSAG supports tone, numeric, and alphanumeric data transmission. POCSAG cannot transmit binary data. POCSAG has three speeds, 512 bps, 1200 bps, and 2400 bps. all three use FSK modulation.

The 512 bps mode was the original and standard POCSAG speed mode. Faster modes constituted the upgraded version, Super-POCSAG, which supported 1200 bps and 2400 bps speeds.

The modulation used is FSK with a Â±4.5 kHz shift on the center carrier. The frequency at +4.5 kHz represents a 0 where the -4.5 kHz represents a 1.

# Frequencies
Note: In many of these regions, the paging frequencies and bands listed below are shared with other radio services, including land mobile two-way radio. In some areas of the United States, the VHF/UHF paging bands listed below are used for land mobile communications. The low-band 35 MHz/43 MHz frequencies and 929-931 MHz frequencies are exclusively allocated to the paging services in the USA. In the United States, 27.255 MHz is available for unlicensed paging and telemetry services under Part 95 of the FCC rules (sections 95.207 and 95.210) on a shared basis with the CB radio service. The UHF (454-467 MHz) allocations are often "interleaved" with land mobile services. For example, 462.850 MHz is used for paging, while adjacent frequencies 462.8375 MHz and 462.8625 MHz are used for low-power business radio service communications. Same goes for the "high side" of those allocations. 467.750 MHz is often used for low-power on-site paging in restaurants, etc, while 467.7625 MHz is a heavily used low-power business radio service frequency. Target Stores (USA) often use the 467.xxx frequencies for in-store voice communications. 467.750 MHz, 467.775 MHz and 467.800 MHz are the most commonly seen. Some systems use the same frequency for voice and POCSAG paging.

In Europe the 26-28 MHz region is heavily populated by land mobile, Citizen's Band (CB) and telemetry traffic in addition to paging systems. The 26.225-26.935 MHz European band is shared with CB in Germany, the Czech Republic, Russia and elsewhere.

In Ireland and the UK, the 26.96-28.0 MHz band is used for Church radio/religious broadcasting services (Wireless Public Address Service - WPAS in Ireland, Community Audio Distribution Service - CADS in the UK) in addition to CB and specialized paging services.
