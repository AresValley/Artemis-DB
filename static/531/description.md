This OTH radar has been located to China but not much else is known about it. Ham radio organizations have reported it on ham bands, causing interference (QRM). It transmits in FMCW mode, 160 kHz wide signal, often 10 sweeps/sec but may use other modes. This radar is seldom heard in Europe unlike some other Chinese radars.

Depending on receiver mode this radar can sound like some other radars, but the wide bandwidth should be noticed.

# Frequencies

Frequency range is not well known but it can be assumed to be similar to other HF skywave OTH radars. Some sources have mentioned 6 to 29 MHz.
