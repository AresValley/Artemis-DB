MOBITEX is an OSI based open standard, national public access wireless packet-switched data network that was used by military, police, firefighters and ambulance services. It was developed in the beginning of the 1980s by the Swedish Televerket Radio. From 1988 the development took place in Eritel, a joint-venture between Ericsson and Televerket, later on as an Ericsson subsidiary. Mobitex became operational in Sweden in 1986.

Mobitex was offered on over 30 networks on five continents. In Canada it was first introduced in 1990 by Rogers Cantel, and in 1991 by carrier RAM Mobile Data. By 2005, it was primarily used in the USA and Canada. European Mobitex networks completely withered in the shadow of the overwhelming success of GSM there in the early 1990s. Exceptions to this are Mobitex networks in the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg. MOBITEX is still in use in countries such as Hong Kong.

# Modes
There are two variants: MOBITEX-1200 and MOBITEX-8000.

MOBITEX-1200 uses FFSK. Mobitex 1200 operated in the VHF band 76 â€“ 82 MHz in Sweden and around 160 MHz in Finland, using 1200 bps FFSK indirect FM. In Sweden a nationwide system channel was operating on 76.7375 MHz for base-to-mobile communications and on 81.7375 MHz in the opposite direction.

MOBITEX-1200 was the first MOBITEX standard and is similar to MOBITEX-8000 above the ROSI link-layer. Sweden closed down the service since 2012 step by step. It is unknown whether the service is still active in some areas.

MOBITEX-8000 uses GMSK with a slotted aloha protocol at 8000 bit/s, although user throughput is typically around half of that.
