Tetrapol is a digital professional mobile radio standard for digital voice and data communication used by public safety and military throughout Europe. Tetrapol was originally developed by Matra Communication (Currently part of EADS/Airbus Group) in France in the 1980s. At the time, the system was known as "Matracom 9600".

The first Tetrapol customers were the Gendarmerie (mid-1992) and the police (early 1995) in France. Today, Tetrapol technology is supported and is being further developed by two organisations: the Tetrapol Forum (predominantly manufacturers) and the Tetrapol User's Club (user organisations). Tetrapol is not to be confused with the similar sounding TETRA system.

Tetrapol uses a documented data format with undocumented voice codec and optional undocumented encryption algorithms. Tetrapol is FDMA with a channel width of 10 kHz or 12.5 kHz.

Tetrapol runs at 8000 Bd with an ACF of 20.069 ms. The raw data rate is 8000 bps.
