DRM+ is a digital audio broadcast mode based on the DRM standard, primarily for use in the WFM broadcast spectrum. It uses COFDM (Coded Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) with QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation).

DRM+ differs from medium wave and HF DRM in that a 100 kHz channel is used for transmission of the digital audio and data, as well as using robustness mode 'E' to guard against fading.

DRM+ is designed to operate in the VHF Broadcast Bands:

- Band I 47-60 MHz
- Band II 87.5-108 MHz
- Band III 174-230 MHz
