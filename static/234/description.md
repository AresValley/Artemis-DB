ILS Marker Beacons are used by aircraft for Instrument Landing Systems, transmitted by an upward-facing directive antenna at known distances along the approach path.

There are three types of marker beacon: Outer Marker (400 Hz dashes), Middle Marker (1020 Hz dot-dashes), Inner Marker (3000 Hz dots). The latter is installed only in ILSs having decision heights of less than 200 feet (60 m).

If the Outer Marker is combined with a NDB (Non Directional Beacon), the two make a "Locator Outer Marker", or LOM. They trigger a three-lights indicator and a togglable aural warning in the cockpit when the aircraft flies directly over them.
