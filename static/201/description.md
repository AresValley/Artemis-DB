Gandalf MDT was developed by Gandalf Mobile Systems, a subsidiary of Canadian company Gandalf Technologies. Used primarily by taxi and courier services in Canada and the United States. This protocol was used in Gandalf's Cabmate systems.

Gandalf's Cabmate system consists of a Dispatch Terminal set up in a driver dash-mounted computer terminal linked by radio transceiver to a host dispatcher's computer. The options available in the Cabmate System include customized city street directory, interface capability with accounting software, an integrated parcel dispatching system and an option which allows drivers to queue into the open available cab list before a fare is completed.

Gandalf Mobile Systems was eventually acquired by Israeli company Geotek Industries in 1993 to contribute it's mobile data terminal IP to Geotek's own system.

Gandalf Technologies eventually went bankrupt in 1997, unable to adapt to the quickly modernizing field of data communications.

The MDT is still in use in some parts of the United States.

UPDATE 2019: The signals responsible are no longer being transmitted.
