The HRD direct broadcast is an X-band continuous downlink from NOAA JPSS satellites of mission environmental data to users on the ground that are equipped with a suitable receiver when the satellite is within view. Offering over 20 times faster data transfer than HRPT, this enables the use of more modern instruments with higher resolution and more channels.
