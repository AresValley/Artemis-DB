This transmitter is found within the UHF FMRS bands, most likely used at airshows to give off barometric pressure, height in altitude represented by a voice, including various tones representing how high/how low the model plane is in the air. Lift is indicated by a pulsed tone with rate and frequency of the pulses depending on the climb rate. Sink is indicated by a low, continuous tone depending on the sink rate. Audible signal and voice messages about model state are transmitted by built-in radio transmitter and can be received on standard LPD or PMR receiver (European version), FRS (American version) or UHF CB (Australian version).
