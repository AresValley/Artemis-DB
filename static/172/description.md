FEC-A, also known as FEC-100 or FEC-100A, is a synchronous simplex ARQ system that uses the ITA 2 alphabet. This mode was once used by many embassies, diplomatic services, and news agencies, including Turkish, German, French, Nigerian, and Serbian. This mode was developed by Siemens.

Users that have used FEC-A:
- Turkish and German Press
- French (P6z) Diplo Services
- Serbian (DFZG) Diplo Services
- Turkish (TAD) Diplo Services

FEC-A has shifts of 85 Hz, 200 Hz, 400 Hz, and 850 Hz. FEC-A has speeds of 96 Bd, 144 Bd, 192 Bd, and 288 Bd. It was once reported that MFA Paris and French Embassy in Romania used a 2x192 Bd speed of 384 Bd.

FEC-A uses a convolutional error correction scheme based on data bits being read into a shift register, the length of which may be changed. Values of 72 and 128 bits are common.
