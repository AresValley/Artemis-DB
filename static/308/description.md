Also known as Racal/Thales Skyfax, Racal/Thales MSM, SKYFAX, Skyfax MSM, JAVELIN MSM-1250, and other variations, MSM-1250 (Medium Speed Modem) is a 10 FSK-2 OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex) digital data protocol used by the stand-alone modem "SkyFax", used to transmit and receive faxes on HF.

There are 10 parallel FSK channels used, each channel spaced 250 Hz apart and with 150 Hz spacing within the channel. Each channel transmits 125 bps, giving a transfer capacity of 1250 bps.

This protocol is often seen with MIL 188-141 (ALE). This protocol was developed by Racal (Now Thales Group) and were used in RC5000 series modems marketed by Racal Canada.
