CDMA2000 also known as TIA/EIA IS-2000 is a 3rd generation cellular standard developed by 3GPP2. CDMA2000 uses CDMA technology, similar to and backwards compatible with its predecessor cdmaOne. This standard is not compatible with and competed with UMTS, developed by 3GPP. CDMA2000 may come in different flavors including CDMA2000 1xRTT or CDMA2000 1xEV-DO, which are different optimizations and improvements to the original CDMA2000 standard. Many operators around the world are phasing out CDMA2000, in favor of the new 5G NR and 4G LTE networks.
