Schneider Trio E-Series Modems are industrial data modems used for SCADA, telemetry, and other ASCII-based messaging applications. These modems were originally developed by Trio Datacom Pty Ltd and sold under their name. In 2011 Trio Datacom, along with Control Microsystems, were acquired by Schneider Electric and were rebranded into Telemetry and Remote SCADA Solutions within Schneider's Industry Business.

Some general characteristics differ based on region, but the common features include 2GMSK/3GMSK/4GMSK waveform within a 12.5 kHz or 25 kHz channel. Within the 25 kHz based waveform (which describes the given audio and IQ sample), a tone spacing of 10 kHz was observed. The symbol rate is presumed to be 9600 sps.

In each data frame sent, a center tone preamble with some sync symbols seem to be transmitted with ~5.2 ms duration. The data payload itself is variable rate, depending on size of payload.

- In Australia (ACMA), the regulatory modes of operation are 4800/9600 bps @ 12.5 kHz channel, or 9600/19200 bps @ 25 kHz channel.
- In the United States (FCC), the regulatory modes of operation are 9600/19200 bps @ 12.5 kHz channel, or 19200 bps @ 25 kHz channel.
- In Europe (ETSI), the regulatory mode of operation is 4800/9600 bps @ 12.5 kHz channel.
An additional mode that was added around 2005 was support for Bell 202 AFSK.
