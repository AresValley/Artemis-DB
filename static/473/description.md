Channel marker of the Russian military station nicknamed "The Goose", for its distinct channel marker sound. It currently uses 3243 kHz in nighttime, and 4310 kHz in daytime. Prior to settling on these frequencies, it was tested on other ones, including 4770kHz.

The Goose began operation on April 11, 2017, originally on 4770 kHz in daytime, and 3012 kHz in nighttime. The daytime frequency would then be changed several times, without affecting the nighttime frequency: on April 15, 2017 to 6360 kHz; on April 14, 2018 to 3750 kHz; and on June 17, 2018 to 4310 kHz. On May 14 and 15, 2019, the station transmitted on the original frequency 4770 kHz during both daytime and nighttime, before returning to the previous 4310/3012 kHz combination - while the Alarm began operation on 4770 kHz the next day.

Later on, the nighttime frequency would also be changed: on October 29, 2019 to 3162 kHz; then on November 16, 2019 to 3243 kHz.

On March 4, 2020, during daytime, the channel marker briefly switched from 4310 kHz to 5360 kHz at 0951z and until 0954z, before reverting to 4310 kHz. On December 30, 2022, it transmitted through the daytime on 4050 kHz instead of 4310 kHz.

On January 21, 2023, while the channel marker was down during a moment of technical difficulties, the Alarm's marker could be faintly heard on the channel instead, hinting again as a relation between the stations.
