Channel marker of the Russian military station nicknamed "The Goose", for its distinct channel marker sound. It currently uses 3243 kHz in nighttime, and 4310 kHz in daytime. Prior to settling on these frequencies, it was tested on other ones, including 4770kHz.

The Goose began operations on April 11, 2017, initially broadcasting on 4770 kHz during the daytime and 3012 kHz at night. The daytime frequency underwent several changes over time, while the nighttime frequency remained constant. The changes to the daytime frequency are outlined below:

- April 15, 2017: Changed to 6360 kHz - April 14, 2018: Changed to 3750 kHz - June 17, 2018: Changed to 4310 kHz

On May 14 and 15, 2019, the station briefly resumed broadcasting on its original frequency, 4770 kHz, for both daytime and nighttime, before reverting to the previous combination of 4310 kHz during the day and 3012 kHz at night. The Alarm station began operations on 4770 kHz the following day.

The nighttime frequency was also modified later on. Here are the changes:

- October 29, 2019: Changed to 3162 kHz - November 16, 2019: Changed to 3243 kHz

On March 4, 2020, the daytime frequency briefly switched from 4310 kHz to 5360 kHz from 0951 to 0954 UTC, before returning to 4310 kHz. On December 30, 2022, it operated during the daytime on 4050 kHz instead of 4310 kHz.

On January 21, 2023, during a moment of technical difficulties when the channel marker was down, the marker for The Alarm could be faintly heard on the channel, suggesting a connection between the two stations.

On April 20, 2024, all stations in The Goose network, including The Goose itself, were turned off. However, The Goose returned on June 27, 2024, broadcasting on the frequencies 4310 kHz and 3243 kHz. Subsequently, from July 19, 2024, The Goose changed its frequencies multiple times:

- July 19, 2024: Daytime on 6780 kHz - July 24, 2024: Nighttime on 4110 kHz - July 25, 2024: Daytime on 6515 kHz - August 1, 2024: Daytime on 6222 kHz

After August 1, 2024, The Goose went off the air and has not been seen since.
