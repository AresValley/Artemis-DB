Golay-Teleprinting Over Radio (G-TOR) is a proprietary standard developed by Kantronics Inc. and is used by radio amateurs, military (Irish Air Corps/Navy, Mexican army) and governmental agencies (ICRC). G-TOR operates at a radio channel rate of 100, 200 or 300 Bd. The quality of the radio channel determines the actual adjusted baud rate. Ireland was a major user of G-TOR.

G-TOR is a protocol that is nearly three times faster than PACTOR, and incorporates features like Golay forward error correction, full-frame interleaving, on-the-fly Huffman data compression (with run-length encoding), fuzzy acknowledgments (for error tolerance), a long ARQ cycle of 2.4 seconds, and a link-quality based transmission rate. All of these combine to minimize the effects of atmospheric noise while resulting in a mode that is robust.

G-TOR was based somewhat on concepts outlined in the MIL-STD-188-100 series of documents, and a protocol devised by M.Golay, that was used by the Voyager space craft to send pictures of Saturn and Jupiter back to Earth.

G-TOR tries to perform all transmissions at 300 baud but drops to 200 baud if difficulties are encountered and finally to 100 baud.
