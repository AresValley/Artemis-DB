**Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) & Mode A/C/S Transponders** is used by aircraft as an alternative to secondary radar. It broadcasts GPS position (latitude, longitude), pressure altitude, callsign, as well as track and ground speed separated into messages carrying 10 bytes of data each. ADS-B uses PPM to transmit data.

There are two types of ADS-B:

- One that transmits at 1090 MHz using the mode-S extended squitter (downlink format 17) of the SSR transponder, with about 2 MHz of bandwidth; (Worldwide)
- One that transmits at 978 MHz (UAT, Universal Access Transceiver), using a larger bandwidth of about 1.3 MHz and also transmitting weather data. (US Only)

## Frequencies
Mode-S Extended Squitter: 1090 MHz
UAT: 978 MHz
Interrogator: 1030 MHz

## Antenna
ADS-B is vertically polarized. High gain antennas such as collinear antennas with gain directed towards the horizon tend to work well. Other antennas like 1/4 wave ground planes and J-Poles also work well.
