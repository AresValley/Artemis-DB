This is a 30-tone OFDM data mode that is believed to be used by Chinese military or other agencies.
The signal is transmitted in bursts, apparently in LSB mode (occasionally in USB), and there is a pilot tone at approximately 445 Hz. Each burst starts with a preamble of 4 tones, spaced 600 Hz apart, first at about 650 Hz, modulated in QPSK. Actual data transmission happens with 30 OFDM tones, each BPSK modulated. Bandwidth of the signal is approximately 3 kHz.
Sometimes more than four tones are seen in the preamble but these may be artifacts from transmitter overdrive or other effect.
Frequency range is not well known but it has a massive amount of transmissions on the HF band. 80 unique frequencies have been found, ranging from 3618 kHz to 18656 kHz.
