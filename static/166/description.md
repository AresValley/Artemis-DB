The Emergency Alert System (EAS) is a national warning system in the United States, implemented since 1997, superseding the Emergency Broadcast System (EBS). The official EAS is designed to enable the President of the United States to speak to the public within 10 minutes. In addition to this requirement, EAS is also designed to alert the public of local weather emergencies such as tornadoes and flash floods.

EAS is jointly coordinated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the National Weather Service (NOAA/NWS).

# Message Format
Messages in the EAS are composed of four parts: Specific Area Message Encoding (SAME) header, an attention signal (1050 Hz for NOAA Weather Radio, 853 Hz and 960 Hz together for commercial broadcast stations), an audio announcement, and a SAME end-of-message marker. For NOAA Weather Alerts, SAME uses NWR-SAME Codes to relay specific alerts, such as tornado warnings, and hurricane advisories.

SAME is an AFSK (Audio Frequency Shift-Keying) protocol used in North America to send digitally encoded information about alerts, advisories, and warnings. Canada and Mexico both utilize SAME in some fashion for weather and disaster alerts The SAME FSK signal itself is 1200Hz wide with a 260Hz shift. Each individual bit lasting 1920 Î¼s (1.92 ms) each, giving a bit rate of 520.8333 bits per second
