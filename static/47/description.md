Automatic Link Establishment, 2G ALE (Official designation MIL-STD-188-141A and/or MIL-STD-188-141B (Appendix A)) is the current standardized method of establishing connections between radio operators. Also known as FED-STD 1045, FED-STD 1049, and STANAG 5066. Although an improved protocol exists (3G ALE), the vast majority of ALE systems in use in the world at the present time are 2G ALE.

2G ALE uses 8 tone MFSK at 125 bd with 250 Hz shifts between tones for a total bandwidth of 2000 Hz

# Operation
To reach a specific station, the caller enters the ALE Address. On many ALE radios this is similar to dialing a phone number. The ALE controller selects the best available idle channel for that destination address. After confirming the channel is indeed idle, it then sends a brief selective calling signal identifying the intended recipient.

When the distant scanning station detects ALE activity, it stops scanning and stays on that channel until it can confirm whether or not the call is for it. The two stations' ALE controllers automatically handshake to confirm that a link of sufficient quality has been established, then notify the operators that the link is up.
