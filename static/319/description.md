Morse Code is the simplest form of transmission found virtually all over the RF bands for a variety of uses. The most common use of this is for Call-sign Beacons by both Amateur and Military operators.

In addition to military and some amateur radio use, there are any number of Numbers stations that send cut numbers using CW. In addition the Russians have been using this mode for years for their military (including their 'Bear' net, used by their Air Force), as well as the Single Letter HF Beacons (SLHFB), the actual purpose of which is not fully understood. The Israelis have used this mode for years for station 4XZ.

CW (Continuous Wave) uses the simple On-Off Keying modulation (OOK). The bandwidth of the CW signal is approximately 4 Hz per WPM (words per minute).

# FSK-CW
FSK-CW means Frequency Shift Keying CW. Instead of OOK, the carrier is always activated as long as the transmission lasts. During pauses between dots, dashes or characters the frequency is shifted downwards. Whilst the upper trace shown on the screen contains the morse information the lower trace is drawn during signal pauses. The advantage of this mode is its redundancy. If, for instance, a dash is falling into pieces caused by QRM (interference) there's still a chance to determine subsequently by checking the lower trace if the signal really had contained that dash or rather several dots.

# Single Letter Beacons
## Description
Single Letter Letter beacons have been referred to as:

- SLHFB, or "Single Letter High Frequency Beacons"
- SLHFM, or "Single Letter High Frequency Markers"
- Cluster beacons
- MX — an ENIGMA and ENIGMA-2000 designation.

The single letter beacons can be classified into two groups, "cluster beacons" and "channel markers". A beacon "P" exists in both groups. A third group, called FSK beacons, is now extinct. The following sections list the beacons currently (December 2007) active, according to published listeners’ reports.

## Cluster Beacons
A group of radio beacons with single-letter identifiers ("C", "D", "M", "S", "P", "A", "M" and "K") have been regularly reported near 3594, 4558, 5154, 7039, 8495, 10872, 13528, 16332 and 20048 kHz. The term "cluster beacons" is frequently used for them, as they transmit in parallel on frequencies only 0.1 kHz apart. These beacons transmit only their single-letter identifier in standard CW (A1A) using Morse code.
