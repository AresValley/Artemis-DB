SITOR-B is one of two modes of SITOR (Simplex Teletype Over Radio). NAVTEX and AMTOR-FEC/AMTOR-B uses the SITOR-B protocol. Based on CCIR 625

This mode is often used in broadcasts of navigational and other warnings from maritime stations. However, not all broadcasts are in English - for example, Istanbul Radio broadcasts in Turkish, while Olympia Radio may broadcast in Greek. This can confuse newcomers to think that their decoder is malfunctioning. See the frequencies section below for a website that lists some of these stations.

In addition, the Czech intelligence services, as well as the Egyptian diplomatic service has been known to use this mode.

Compared to SITOR-A, SITOR-B doesn't use ARQ. Instead, it uses FEC by sending each character twice during transmission.
