High speed modem for qo-100 amateur satellite narrow transponder.

The purpose of this project is to transfer data (pictures, ...) via a 2,7kHz SSB channel on the narrow band transponder as fast as possible. Now also including RTTY mode.

A characteristic feature of the signal is the presence of a 100 hertz carrier for fine tuning(not visible on the websdr waterfall).
