Data signal thought to originate from Japanese Military/Navy. Although 8-Channels are used, it is actually two FSK channels duplicated with Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) among the other 6 channels for high redundancy.

The signal consists of two independent FSK-2 channels which are doubled according to a cross-schema. All four channels use the Manchester code and, with time offset between the two channels, formed using OFDM.
