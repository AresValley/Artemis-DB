Mazielka (X06) is a diplomatic selcall system used by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Used to alert that a Serdolik transmission is going to occur soon, usually on a different frequency. Has only 6 tones, representing numbers 1 through 6, and transmits the same 5 number group repetitively.

The name "Mazielka" comes from a Russian instrument that sounds similar to flute, the sound of which early listeners associated with X06.

There are a few variants in which this signal can be seen in.

- X06a is a variant of X06 that sends two alternating tones, and can last for hours. This is most likely a testing pattern.
- X06b is a variant of X06, where the tone sequences feature consecutive tones. Mostly two or three consecutive tones in a sequence are observed, but rarely there are sequences which only feature a single tone.
- X06c is a variant of X06 where the tone sequence is a continuous rising pattern. This is also considered to be a testing pattern.

X06 is usually found transmitting on single upper side band with a full carrier, but it has been seen transmitting on DSB/AM on occasion as well as in single upper side band without a carrier.
